A combination of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, Vilsmeier formylation, and condensation reactions was used to synthesize the intermediates and final products.

The molecular arrangement of these $\\mathrm{D}-\\pi-\\mathrm{A}$ systems leads to terminal electron donor and acceptor group communication through a $\\pi$-conjugated bridge. This intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) involves a new low-energy molecular orbital, accessible through visible light excitation, which is responsible for the polarization of the molecule. ${ }^{1,2}$\n\nOptoelectronic properties of these push-pull systems may have applications in field-effect transistors, ${ }^{3}$ light-emitting diodes, ${ }^{4}$ nonlinear optics [second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon absorption $],^{5-7}$ photovoltaics, ${ }^{8-13}$ and near-infrared absorbing dyes. ${ }^{14}$\n\nThese push-pull systems may be tailored toward specific applications by changing electron donor or acceptor moieties, spacer (conjugation length, planarity, and electronic nature), and the overall chromophore arrangement. An efficient method of tuning the electronic properties of these systems involves incorporation of heterocyclic units, which provide high polarizability, thermal and chemical robustness, and possibilities for further structural changes. In addition, they can behave as both efficient spacers and auxiliary electron donor/ acceptor groups. A variety of $\\pi$-bridges and donor and acceptor groups have been used in the design of heterocyclic push-pull heterocyclic dyes. ${ }^{1,2}$\n\nAromatic hydrazone-based compounds have been studied in several areas of materials chemistry, such as organic nonlinear optical $(\\mathrm{NLO})^{15-18}$ and hole-transport materials, and so forth. ${ }^{19,20}$ These compounds have been of particular interest because of the easy synthetic access through reaction of carbonyl compounds (particularly aldehydes) with relatively low-cost starting materials, avoiding expensive catalysts. They are also tolerant to the presence of water and/or oxygen. Other\n\nReceived: May 25, 2018\n\nAccepted: July 27, 2018\n\nPublished: October 9, 2018 Scheme 1.

Their optical and redox properties have been evaluated, and they have been tested in DSSC photovoltaic devices.\n\n\\section{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}\n2.1. Synthesis and Characterization. A series of pushpull heterocyclic chromophores were prepared to study the effect of different spacers (bithiophene and thieno[3,2$b]$ thiophene) and electron-withdrawing moieties (carboxylic acid, cyanoacetic acid, and dicyanovinyl) on their linear and NLO properties, redox behavior, and potential as sensitizers in DSSCs based on nanocrystalline titania. All of the compounds bear a $N, N$-diphenylhydrazone donor unit that was chosen because of its high charge mobility properties as an electron donor. ${ }^{25}$ The thiophene units in the $\\pi$-spacer show excellent charge-transfer properties, efficient $\\pi$-conjugation, and low geometrical relaxation upon oxidation. ${ }^{29,3}$\n\nThe aldehyde precursor $2 \\mathbf{c}$ was prepared in good yield (53\\%) by Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxylic acid and 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid. Intermediates $\\mathbf{3 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and push-pull chromophore $7 \\mathbf{c}$ were synthesized in moderate to good yields $(55-72 \\%)$ through condensation of the respective aldehydes $2 \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{c}$ with $N, N$ diphenylhydrazone $\\mathbf{1}$ in ethanol. The intermediate aldehydes $\\mathbf{4 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ were obtained $(45-58 \\%$ yields) by Vilsmeier-Haack formylation. Knoevenagel condensation (piperidine catalyst) in refluxing ethanol of the aldehydes $4 \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ with 2 -cyanoacetic acid gave the push-pull chromophores $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ in fair to good yields $(27-58 \\%)$, whereas dyes $\\mathbf{6 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ were prepared in fair yields $(22-29 \\%)$ by condensation of the same aldehydes with malononitrile (Scheme 1).\n\nRecently, the synthesis of precursor 3a was reported by Roncali and collaborators through condensing N,N-diphenylhydrazine with aldehyde $2 \\mathbf{a}$, in $63 \\%$ yield, using different experimental conditions: $\\mathrm{MeOH} /$ tetrahydrofuran in the presence of sodium acetate. Aldehyde $4 b$ was also reported, in $37 \\%$ yield, using a one-step methodology by condensing $N, N$-diphenylhydrazine with 5,5'-diformylbithiophene. The same investigators also published the synthesis of dyes $\\mathbf{6} \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ using different reaction conditions $\\left(\\mathrm{NET}_{3}\\right.$ as the base and $\\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}$ as the solvent). ${ }^{23}$\n\nThe structures of these compounds were confirmed by standard procedures (detailed characterization and Table S1 with experimental data in the Supporting Information).\n\n2.2. Electrochemical Study. To obtain energies of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) redox properties of the compounds, $\\mathbf{5 a} \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV). In DSSCs, dye $\\mathbf{N} 719$ is most commonly used; its band gap energy is appropriate for absorption in the visible region of the solar spectra; energies of LUMO and HOMO fit well for electron injection into $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and regeneration of the dye. Data on the electrochemical behavior of $\\mathbf{N} 719$ are presented as a \"reference\". The energies of HOMO and LUMO of $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $7 \\mathrm{c}$ were calculated. The energy level of ferrocene $(4.39 \\mathrm{eV})$ was used as the reference. Table 1 summarizes the data. For compounds 5 and 7 , the redox behavior is reversible; whatever scan rate of potential is applied, the potentials of cathodic and anodic peaks of current remain constant. Potentials for oxidation of compounds $\\mathbf{5 a}, \\mathbf{5 b}$, and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ are $0.73,0.67$, and $0.64 \\mathrm{~V}$, respectively. These potentials are higher than the potential of the $3 \\mathrm{I}^{-} / \\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}$couple $(0.42 \\mathrm{~V})$, which in the case of application in solar cells, reduces back transfer of electrons to the electrolyte. ${ }^{48,49}$ The oxidation potential clearly depends on the electronic nature of the heteroaromatic spacer unit: the stronger the auxiliary electron-donating ability, the easier it is to oxidize the molecule. The bithiophene derivative $\\mathbf{5 b}$ displays the lowest oxidation potential (highest energy of HOMO), suggesting a slightly stronger electron-donating ability when compared to compound $\\mathbf{5 a}$ (this is in accordance with the UV-vis spectral data). The LUMO level of the dyes indicates the thermodynamic possibility of the electron injection into the conduction band of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ such that the LUMO level of the Table 1.

Compound $\\mathbf{5 b}$ shows the lower LUMO level of all studied dyes $(-2.65 \\mathrm{eV})$, indicating the lowest thermodynamic driving force for electron injection. Compound $7 \\mathrm{c}$ exhibits the highest band gap among the compounds studied $(2.92 \\mathrm{eV})$, indicating that its photoexcitation is less efficient at long wavelengthsexcitation requires higher energies. Even though the HOMO level is similar to that of compound $\\mathbf{5 b}$, the LUMO level is much higher, which could be ascribed to the lower ability for electron capture by the carboxylic group present in $7 \\mathrm{c}$ when compared to the cyanoacetic moiety in $\\mathbf{5 b}$.\n\n2.3. Optical Studies. 2.3.1. Linear Optical Properties. The absorption and emission spectra of heterocyclic compounds 3-7 were studied in ethanol, at room temperature. Table 2 summarizes the data, whereas Figure 1 displays the\n\nTable 2.

All of the push-pull chromophores studied exhibit at least one strong broad absorption band between 416 and $456 \\mathrm{~nm}$ that is assigned to an ICT between the electron donor and acceptor groups. The peak of these absorption bands varies according to the spacer and electron-withdrawing moieties employed. The substitution of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene for the bithiophene moiety as the spacer induces a bathochromic shift in the longest wavelength absorption $(\\Delta \\lambda=5 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for compounds 3 , $\\Delta \\lambda=30 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for compounds $4, \\Delta \\lambda=21 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for compounds 5 , and $\\Delta \\lambda=25 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for compounds 6) that is explained by the slight increase of the $\\pi$-conjugation path and the enhanced auxiliary donor effect of bithiophene. Shifts of the absorption maxima are also observed when comparing the acceptor groups; generally, the higher the conjugation length and electron-withdrawing ability, the longer is the wavelength of maximum of absorption. For compounds 3 and 4, the introduction of a formyl group leads to bathochromic shifts in the range of 42-67 nm. Comparing compounds 4 and 5 , the substitution of the formyl group for the 2-cyanoacetic acid moiety induces another bathochromic shift of $16-25 \\mathrm{~nm}$ because of the stronger acceptor characteristics of the cyanoacetic group as well as the increase of conjugation. Comparison of compounds $4 \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{6 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ shows that the dicyanovinyl group causes bathochromic shifts around 8-13 $\\mathrm{nm}$. Moreover, a hypsochromic shift of $24 \\mathrm{~nm}$ is observed on comparing absorption spectra of compounds $4 b$ and $7 c$ because of the substitution of the electron-withdrawing formyl group by a carboxylic acid group. This result was not expected, bearing in mind the lower conjugation of the aldehyde compared to the carboxylic acid moiety. The novel cyanoacetic chromophores $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ have high molar extinction coefficients (20 141-30740 $\\left.\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\\right)$ compared to the dicyanovinyl derivatives $\\mathbf{6 a}-\\mathbf{b} \\quad\\left(19221-26766 \\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\\right)$. Exciting compounds 3-7 at the maximum absorption wavelength, their emission spectra were recorded under room-temperature conditions (Figure 1, Table 2). The fluorescence was significantly influenced by the nature of the spacer and acceptor groups; generally, an increase in the extent of the $\\pi$ conjugated system or functionalization with stronger electron donor or acceptor groups shifts the spectra to longer wavelengths. With the exception of compound $3 \\mathbf{b}\\left(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{F}}=\\right.$ $0.20)$, all heterocyclic systems showed very weak emissive properties, with relative fluorescence quantum yields ranging from $0.01$ to $0.03$. When a nitrogen heteroatom is involved in the $\\pi$-system, the $n \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ transition may be the lowest lying transition and is characterized by a radiative lifetime at least 100 times longer than that of low lying $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ transitions. Under these conditions, nonradiative processes are dominant, leading to low fluorescence quantum yields of many azo\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-03_2205_2569_466_1710}\n\nFigure 1. Normalized absorption (full solid lines) and emission (dashed lines) spectra for compounds 4-7 in ethanol at room temperature. compounds as well as some compounds containing carbonyl groups and nitrogen heterocycles. As expected, a red shift of the emission of the compounds is observed upon increasing the strength of the acceptor group (aldehyde < carboxylic acid $<$ cyanoacetic acid < dicyanovinyl). Thienothiophenes $4 \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{5 a}$, and $6 \\mathrm{a}$ show emissions at 480,519 , and $564 \\mathrm{~nm}$, respectively, whereas bithiophenes $\\mathbf{4 b}, \\mathbf{5 b}, \\mathbf{6 b}$, and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ exhibit emissions at $536,574,591$, and $501 \\mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. A bathochromic shift is also observed upon increasing the $\\pi$-conjugation path length though the bithiophene spacer, comparing compound $4 \\mathbf{a}$ with $\\mathbf{4 b}(7 \\mathrm{~nm})$, compound $\\mathbf{5 a}$ with $\\mathbf{5 b}$ (52 $\\mathrm{nm})$, and compound $\\mathbf{6 a}$ with $6 \\mathbf{b}(18 \\mathrm{~nm})$. All of the studied push-pull systems show large Stokes' shifts $\\left(3557-5910 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\\right)$, indicating that significant structure relaxation occurs in the excited state upon absorption. Moreover, the compounds functionalized with stronger electron-withdrawing cyanoacetic acid and dicyanovinyl moieties 5-6 exhibit larger Stokes' shifts than the corresponding aldehyde precursors 4. This is consistent with the possibility of increased ICT upon absorption, particularly in the case of the dicyanovinyl moieties for which the Stokes shift increase is greater than $50 \\%$.\n\n2.3.2. NLO Properties. Hyper-Rayleigh scattering $^{50,51}$ (HRS) was used to characterize the molecular first hyperpolarizabilities $\\beta$ of push-pull $N, N$-diphenylhydrazone derivatives 5-7. The incident laser beam had a fundamental wavelength of $1064 \\mathrm{~nm}$, and the chromophores were dissolved in dioxane. The mean hyperpolarizability values, $\\beta$, were determined by comparison with a $p$-nitroaniline (pNA) reference solution. ${ }^{52,53}$ The extent that the second harmonic signal might be contaminated by multiphoton-induced fluorescence was taken into account by measuring the HRS signal over different spectral bandwidths (see Supporting Information for more details). The static hyperpolarizabilities $\\beta_{0}$ were estimated via a simple two-level model neglecting damping. ${ }^{54-56}$ Both an increase in the $\\pi$-conjugation of the spacer and an intensification of the electronic acceptor ability of the withdrawing group clearly influence the nonlinearities of compounds 4-7 as quantified in Table 3. First, the measured $\\beta$ values show that the bithiophene spacer leads to higher molecular hyperpolarizability values than the thieno[3,2$b]$ thiophene moiety. Therefore, aldehyde $4 \\mathbf{b}$ has a higher $\\beta$ value $\\left(\\beta=290 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{esu}\\right)$ than $4 \\mathbf{a}\\left(\\beta=205 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{esu}\\right)$, as does cyanoacetic acid $5 \\mathbf{b}\\left(\\beta=2330 \\times 10^{-30}\\right.$ esu $)$ when\n\nTable 3.

The static hyperpolarizability $\\beta_{0}$ values of the compounds follow the same trend. The more extensive $\\pi$ conjugation and stronger auxiliary electron-donating ability of the bithiophene moiety are probably the main reasons for these trends. We also notice a general increase of the hyperpolarizability $\\beta$ as the electron-accepting ability is increased and as the electronic conjugation of the acceptor end moiety becomes larger. In the case of compounds bearing thieno $[3,2-b]$ thiophene $(\\mathbf{4 a}, \\mathbf{5 a}$, and $\\mathbf{6 a})$, the SHG response is enhanced by an increase of the acceptor group strength upon changing the aldehyde group $\\left(\\beta=205 \\times 10^{-30}\\right.$ esu for $\\left.4 a\\right)$ to a dicyanovinyl group $\\left(\\beta=265 \\times 10^{-30}\\right.$ esu for $\\left.6 \\mathbf{a}\\right)$ and then for a cyanoacetic acid moiety $\\left(\\beta=930 \\times 10^{-30}\\right.$ esu for $\\left.\\mathbf{5 a}\\right)$. A similar tendency is observed in compounds bearing bithiophene as the spacer $(\\mathbf{4 b}, \\mathbf{5 b}, \\mathbf{6 b}$, and $7 \\mathbf{c})$. Derivative $4 \\mathbf{b}$ shows the lowest hyperpolarizability $\\beta$, followed by the carboxylic acid $7 \\mathbf{c}$. Chromophores $\\mathbf{5 b}$ and $\\mathbf{6 b}$ exhibit the highest values of $\\beta(2330$ $\\times 10^{-30}$ esu for $\\mathbf{5 b}$ and $2750 \\times 10^{-30}$ esu for $\\left.\\mathbf{6 b}\\right)$; however, in this case, the dicyanovinyl derivative $\\mathbf{6 b}$ has higher SHG response than the cyanoacetic derivative $\\mathbf{5 b}$. The lower hyperpolarizability $\\beta$ value of $\\mathbf{5 b}$ might be a result of the distorted conformation of the $\\pi$-system due not only to the bithiophene spacer but also the cyanoacetic acid moiety when compared to the dicyanovinyl group. This could result in a suppression of electron transfer, even though the dominant conformer is planar between the spacer and acceptor moieties. ${ }^{43}$ This result is in accordance with the electrochemical study of dyes $\\mathbf{6}$, previously reported by Roncali et al., ${ }^{23}$ where we noticed that the LUMO levels in dyes 6 do not follow the same trend as in dyes 5: the introduction of the bithiophene spacer in dye $\\mathbf{6 b}$ leads to a destabilization of the LUMO $(-3.45 \\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\mathbf{6 a}$ and $-3.39 \\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\mathbf{6 b}$ ), which is expected because of the stronger donating ability of the auxiliary electron, whereas in dye $\\mathbf{5 b}$, the opposite occurs. The static hyperpolarisability $\\beta_{0}$ values for the compounds show the same trend.\n\n2.4. Performance in DSSCs. Recently, several groups have reported that photovoltaic efficiencies ranged from $3.30$ to $7.74 \\%$ for organic hydrazine dyes bearing different $\\pi$-spacers/ electron donor groups (thiophene, pyrrole, furan, triphenylamino, and tetrahydroquinoline) and functionalized with various anchoring moieties (cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine acetic acid). ${ }^{24-28}$ Therefore, we decided to expand these earlier studies as well as our work concerning organic sensitizers bearing bithiophene and thienothiophene spacers ${ }^{42-45}$ to the synthesis of the novel bithiophene and thienothiophene dyes $\\mathbf{5 a} \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{7 c}$ to be evaluated as sensitizers for DSSCs.\n\nPerformance metrics of the DSSCs (efficiency- $\\eta$, filling factor-FF, max. power point-MPP, voltage at open circuit- $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$, current density at short-circuit- $J_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ ) sensitized with dyes 5a-b and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ and N719 reference dye, as well as the results from the coadsorption with deoxycholic acid (DCA) are presented in Table 4. The current-voltage characteristics of the prepared DSSCs are presented in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) and Figure 2 and show shapes typical for photodiodes for all of the cells. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are presented in Figure 3.\n\nThe DSSC prepared using $N, N$-diphenylhydrazone dye $7 \\mathbf{c}$ exhibits the lowest efficiency $(0.72 \\%)$. The very low $J_{S C}(2.01$ $\\mathrm{mA} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ ) could be related to the low extinction coefficient Table 4.

The IPCE spectra of the DSSC with 7c dye supports these assumptions; only the higher energy photons from the spectral region $350-$ $450 \\mathrm{~nm}$ are able to turn the dye to its photoexcited state and contribute to photocurrent. However, this could turn to the advantage of this dye for \"greenhouse\" concept, where high transparency of the integrated photovoltaic device is eventually important.\n\nDSSCs prepared using dyes $\\mathbf{5 a} \\mathbf{- b}$ show very similar photovoltaic efficiencies: $2.98 \\%$ for $\\mathbf{5 a}$ and $3.01 \\%$ for $\\mathbf{5 b}$. The slightly higher efficiency of the DSSC sensitized with $\\mathbf{5 b}$ dye (about 33\\% of the efficiency of the DSSC with N719 dye), bearing a bithiophene moiety as the $\\pi$-spacer/auxiliary electron\n\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-05_1270_1317_198_1045}\\\\\ncould be due to the longer $\\pi$-conjugation of the sensitizing dye and lower electronic band gap when compared to dye $\\mathbf{5 a}$.\n\nTo enhance the efficiency of the DSSCs sensitized with dyes $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$, we used coadsorption with DCA. Bile acids such as DCA and chenodeoxycholic acid are able to improve the efficiency of the cells because of the reduction of dye aggregation on the surface of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$, suppressing dark current and improving electron lifetime. 25,\n\nThe photovoltaic response of the cells with dyes $5 \\mathbf{a}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ was increased slightly by the addition of DCA as the coadsorbent (from $2.98$ to $3.22 \\%$ for dye $5 \\mathbf{a}$ and from $0.72$ to $0.79 \\%$ for dye $7 \\mathrm{c}$ ), whereas the efficiency of the cell with dye 5b improved significantly-from $3.01$ to $5.10 \\%$. It can be seen from Table 4 and Figure 2 that the addition of DCA does not affect $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$ of the cells based on dyes $\\mathbf{5 a}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$-the variations are within the statistical deviation. The slight enhancement of the performance of these cells is due to the improvement of the FF via suppressing the dark current. At the same time, for dye $\\mathbf{5 b}$, coadsorption of DCA leads to noticeable increase of $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the addition of DCA to the sensitization solutions causes perceptible bathochromic shifts\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-05_221_701_1267_1819}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure 3.

Noteworthy, a pronounced improvement of quantum yield above $550 \\mathrm{~nm}$ for the cell based on dye $5 \\mathbf{b}$ was observed (Figure 4). The overall performance of the DSSC with dye $\\mathbf{5 b}$ coadsorbed with DCA was found to be $5.01 \\%$, which is promising for metal-free organic dyes.\n\n2.5. Computational Studies. The metal-free organic sensitizers $5 \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ considered in our study have many possible conformations. Different conformers can have very different degrees of conjugation; therefore, it is important to determine the lowest energy conformers responsible for the observed absorption spectra of the dyes. For dyes $\\mathbf{5} \\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{5 b}$, 12 conformers were considered in each case, differing in the relative arrangements of the carboxylic acid, cyano, bithiophene (or thienothiophene), and N,N-diphenylhydrazone groups. For dye $7 \\mathbf{c}$, we investigated the structures and energies of four different conformers. For dyes $\\mathbf{5 b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$, a simplification was introduced by considering only the thiophene-thiophene trans conformers. This is justified in view of previous studies, ${ }^{43,58}$ which showed that the cis conformation usually accounts for ca. $10 \\%$ of the population of conformers in this type of structures. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the most stable conformers of these dyes and their relative energies calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy differences found for these forms indicate a population of about $58 \\%$ for conformer 5a-I, $77 \\%$ for conformer $\\mathbf{5 b}$-I, and $53 \\%$ for conformer $7 \\mathbf{c}$-I. Because these are the dominant conformers, our subsequent analysis will be carried out for these forms, and for simplicity, we will\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-05_2148_2534_545_1617}\n\nFigure 2.

In the three dyes, the cyano and the carboxylic groups are coplanar with the thienothiophene (in 5a) or bithiophene (in $\\mathbf{5 b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ ) $\\pi$-bridges, showing strong conjugation between the $\\pi$-orbitals of these groups. This is convenient because it will improve the efficiency of electron transfer from the bridge to the electron acceptor. Dye $7 \\mathrm{c}$ is slightly distorted in the region between the donor and the $\\pi$-bridge.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-06_1270_1930_196_1048}\n\nFigure 5.

The larger extension of the conjugation in the chain in $\\mathbf{5 b}$ leads to a smaller band gap for this dye. Dye $7 \\mathrm{c}$ has the smallest conjugated chain, and for this reason, it has the highest band gap of the three dyes considered. This leads to a red shift of the first band in the absorption spectra of $\\mathbf{5 b}$ and a blue shift of the first band in the spectra of 7c, compared with 5a. The LUMO levels are significantly lower for $\\mathbf{5 a}$ and $\\mathbf{5 b}$, compared with $7 \\mathbf{c}$, in agreement with the cyanoacetic group being a better electron acceptor than the carboxylic one. The LUMO levels are above $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of titania $(-4.0 \\mathrm{eV}$ vs vacuum $){ }^{59}$ and the levels of $\\mathrm{HOMO}$ are below the redox potential of $3 \\mathrm{I}^{-} / \\mathrm{I}_{3}^{-}(-4.6 \\mathrm{eV}$ vs vacuum). ${ }^{60}$ For utilizing in DSSCs, this means that the necessary driving force is provided for electron injection into the semiconductor and the regeneration of the dyes by the electrolyte. The data acquired from CV are provided in Figure 6 (green solid lines). One can see that HOMO and LUMO energies match very well the experimental CV values.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-06_1041_1496_1261_1825}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure 6.

LUMO and HOMO are indicated as \"L\" and \"H\", respectively.\n\nThe UV-vis absorption spectra (vertical electronic excitations) were calculated for the free dyes at the timedependent-DFT (TD-DFT)/CAM-B3LYP level, and the main contributions to the transitions with maximum absorption involve the HOMO - 1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO $+1$ orbitals (Figure 7 and Table 5). For 5a, the maximum absorption transition has a computed wavelength of $446 \\mathrm{~nm}$ (experimental value $435 \\mathrm{~nm}$ in ethanol) and corresponds predominantly to a $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow$ LUMO excitation $(85 \\%)$ with small contributions from HOMO - $1 \\rightarrow \\operatorname{LUMO}(8 \\%)$ and $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+1(3 \\%)$ configurations. The maximum absorption of $\\mathbf{5 b}$ (calculated value is $470 \\mathrm{~nm}$ and experimental value in ethanol is $456 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ) is red-shifted relatively to $5 \\mathbf{a a}$, as discussed above, and the dominant contributions to this transition are the HOMO $\\rightarrow$ LUMO $(79 \\%), \\mathrm{HOMO}-1 \\rightarrow$ LUMO $(14 \\%)$, and $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow$ LUMO $+1(5 \\%)$ excitations. Dye $7 \\mathrm{c}$ has its maximum absorption blue-shifted relative to $5 \\mathbf{a}$ and $5 \\mathbf{b}$. The calculated maximum appears at $399 \\mathrm{~nm}$ (in ethanol solvent, the experimental value is $416 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ), and as with dyes $\\mathbf{5 a}$ and $\\mathbf{5 b}$, the main contribution is a HOMO $\\rightarrow$ LUMO excitation (86\\%). From Figure 7, one can see the type of the orbitals involved in these transitions. The HOMOs are\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-07_228_808_458_1706}\n\nFigure 7. B3LYP/6-31G $(\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{p})$ frontier molecular orbitals of the free dyes $\\mathbf{5 a}, \\mathbf{5 b}$, and $7 \\mathbf{c}$.\n\n$\\pi$ orbitals, mainly localized on the donor and the thienothiophene (in $\\mathbf{5 a}$ ) or bithiophene (in $5 \\mathbf{b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$ ) $\\pi$ bridges, whereas the LUMOs are $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals essentially on the acceptor group and on the $\\pi$-bridges. The HOMO $-1 \\rightarrow$ LUMO and HOMO $\\rightarrow$ LUMO $+1$ excitations tend to decrease the charge separation between the ground and excited states in these dyes; however, their contributions to the transition are very small. Therefore, there is efficient charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor upon excitation.\n\nAdsorption of the dye on $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ causes a reorganization of the electronic states of the semiconductor. ${ }^{61-63}$ This can affect the electronic absorption spectra of the dyes and also the efficiency of injection of electrons into $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the effect of adsorption of the dyes on their structural and electronic properties at the interface. Because of computational limitations, we only carried out this analysis for the dye $\\mathbf{5 a}$ adsorbed on $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$. Two types of approaches have been used to model the dye $\\cdots \\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ interface. One is based on the simulation of the dye adsorbed to an infinitely large particle of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$, in one or multiple dimensions, employing a periodic condition and using plane-wave basis sets. The second approach considers the dye adsorbed to an isolated cluster of $\\left(\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\right)_{n}$ and the calculations use a localized basis set. ${ }^{61-68}$ Both methods present advantages, and in our study, we have used the second one. The size of the cluster, $\\left(\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\right)_{9}$, and the bidentate mode of adsorption in which the dye is covalently linked to a Ti atom of the cluster through the two oxygen atoms of the anchoring carboxylic group were also chosen based on the literature. ${ }^{62,64,69,70}$ To keep electroneutrality of the system, the hydrogen atom coming from deprotonation ${ }^{71}$ of the anchoring carboxylic group was linked to a cluster oxygen atom. ${ }^{62,66}$ The geometry of the $5 \\mathbf{a} / \\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ system was optimized at the DFT level; the effect of dye adsorption on the energy levels of the orbitals is presented in Figure 8. The LUMO and the next virtual orbitals in the combined $\\mathbf{5 a} / \\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ system are stabilized relative to the same orbitals of the free dye. This is a consequence of the introduction of additional electronic states by the semiconductor. The HOMO and the next occupied orbitals are also slightly stabilized. Interestingly, however, there is no shift in the absorption maximum of the dye in the combined system, as we can see from Table 5. For the dye $\\mathbf{5 a}$ adsorbed to $\\left(\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\right)_{9}$, TD-DFT calculations estimate an absorption maximum at $446 \\mathrm{~nm}$, the same value as for the free dye. The maximum absorption transition in the combined $\\mathbf{5 a} / \\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ system has now significantly different contributions. Two dominant contributions come from the HOMO $\\rightarrow$ LUMO $(37 \\%)$ and $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow$ LUMO $+3(36 \\%)$ excitations, together with minor contributions from HOMO $\\rightarrow$ LUMO $+1(4 \\%)$, $\\mathrm{HOMO}-1 \\rightarrow \\operatorname{LUMO}(4 \\%), \\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+4(4 \\%)$, $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+6(4 \\%)$, and $\\mathrm{HOMO}-1 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+3$ (3\\%)\n\nIt should be noted that these energy gaps are different in the two systems. Smaller contributions come also from excitations with larger energy gaps, such as $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+25$, $\\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+26, \\mathrm{HOMO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LUMO}+27$, and so forth, which are absent in the case of the free dye. The sum of all of these contributions in the case of $5 \\mathbf{a} / \\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ gives a resulting vertical excitation energy which is similar to one of the free dye.\n\nAlthough their energy suffers slight changes, the HOMO and $\\mathrm{HOMO}-1$ in the combined $5 \\mathrm{a} / \\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ system (Figure 9) are essentially equivalent to these orbitals in the free dye. In contrast, the LUMO and the remaining virtual orbitals involved in the maximum absorption transition are localized predominantly on the cluster. The LUMO $+3, \\mathrm{LUMO}+4$, and LUMO $+6$ also extend to the acceptor and $\\pi$-bridge. The distribution of electron density in these orbitals shows that there will be efficient electron injection from the excited dye into $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ in a $\\mathrm{DSSC}$.\n\nTo discuss further the relation between the performance of the chromophores as sensitizers for $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2} \\mathrm{DSSCs}$ and their second-order $\\mathrm{NLO}$ response, we focus on a comparison between compounds $\\mathbf{5} \\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{5 b}$. These chromophores differ only in their $\\pi$-electron bridge and should have similar coupling efficiencies for electron transfer to the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ substrate. Given the tendency of many $\\mathrm{D}-\\pi-\\mathrm{A}$ molecules to form $\\pi$ stacked aggregates on the surface of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ clusters, which will encourage the back transfer of electrons and, consequently, decrease DSSC efficiency, we further restrict our attention to the measurements using the coabsorber DCA, known for its ability to dissociate $\\pi$-aggregates. The ratio of the efficiency of the $\\mathbf{5 b}+$ DCA DSSC to that of the $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathrm{DCA}$ DSSC is $5.10 \\%: 3.22 \\% \\approx 1.6$, roughly equal to the ratio of the extrapolated hyperpolarizabilities, $300: 180 \\approx 1.7$. Interestingly, the DFT-estimated oscillator strengths of the first singlet transition listed in Table 5 indicate that chromophore 5a has a stronger dipole optical transition moment than chromophore 5b. This suggests that the asymmetry in the optical fieldinduced polarizability of chromophore $\\mathbf{5 b}$ is greater, which\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_4ef39bb4116ac1dad9e9g-08_224_2650_212_1828}\n\nFigure 8.

We note that the DFT study carried out on chromophore $\\mathbf{5 a}$ coupled to a $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ cluster indicated that because of the interaction between the chromophore and the substrate, the character of the first singlet transition changed; a substantial mixing of the LUMO $+3$ state was accompanied by a strong reduction in the participation of the LUMO state (see Table 5). As the electron density of LUMO $+3$ extends far into the $\\pi$-bridge, this could result in less efficient electron collection by the substrate. The existence of a stronger chargetransfer asymmetry in chromophore $\\mathbf{5 b}$ might counteract this delocalization of the electron density from the $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ cluster, promoting higher DSSC efficiencies.\n\n\\section{CONCLUSIONS}\n$N, N$-Diphenylhydrazone derivatives 3-7 were obtained in fair to good yields, using commercially available precursors and simple, convenient synthetic and purification procedures. Condensation of aldehydes $\\mathbf{2 a}-\\mathbf{c}$ with $N, N$-diphenylhydrazine gave intermediates $\\mathbf{3 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$. Further functionalization of precursors $\\mathbf{3 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ through Vilsmeier formylation allowed the preparation of formyl derivatives $\\mathbf{4 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ that, through Knoevenagel condensation, gave the push-pull compounds $5-6$.\n\nExperimental and theoretical characterization of the absorption, fluorescence, and NLO and electrochemical properties of the systems were carried out as a means to evaluate their potential as photosensitizers for nanocrystalline $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$-based DSSCs. The effect of different $\\pi$-spacers and acceptor groups was evaluated. These comparative studies demonstrate that the incorporation the bithiophene $\\pi$-bridge enhances the electron donor effect when compared with thienothiophene and that the dicyanovinyl acceptor group, although less conjugated than cyanoacetic acid and a weaker electron-withdrawing moiety, induces less distortion to the heterocyclic system, which can be advantageous.\n\nChromophores $5 \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{6 b}$ exhibit the highest hyperpolarizability $\\beta\\left(2330 \\times 10^{-30}\\right.$ esu for $\\mathbf{5 b}, 2750 \\times 10^{-30}$ esu for $\\mathbf{6 b}$ ). The lower hyperpolarizability $\\beta$ value of $\\mathbf{5 b}$, which is the more strongly conjugated system, could be attributed to the distorted conformation of the $\\pi$-system due not only to the bithiophene spacer but also to the cyanoacetic acid moiety.\n\nCompound $\\mathbf{5 b}$, bearing a bithiophene $\\pi$-spacer, exhibits the best conversion efficiency $(3.01 \\%)$ when used as a sensitizer for nanocrystalline titania in DSSCs because of the lower electronic band gap and longer $\\pi$-conjugation of the sensitizing dye. Studies of coadsorption were performed by adding DCA to the sensitizing mixtures, revealing slight improvements for the cells based on dyes $5 \\mathbf{a}$ and $7 \\mathbf{c}$, whereas the efficiency of the DSSCs with dye $\\mathbf{5 b}$ was significantly enhanced from $3.01$ to $5.10 \\%$. This improvement originated from the bathochromic shift of the adsorption spectra of the dye $\\mathbf{5 b}$ in the presence of DCA and consequential widening of the spectral response of the photocurrent quantum yield.\n\nFurther optimization of the molecular structure of all chromophores should lead to enhanced hyperpolarizabilities and photovoltaic efficiencies.\n\n\\section{EXPERIMENTAL SECTION}\n4.1. Materials and Methods. $N, N$-Diphenylhydrazine hydrochloride, 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxylic acid, thieno[3,2-b] thiophene-2-carbaldehyde, 2,2'-bithiophene-5-carboxaldehyde, phosphorous oxychloride, malononitrile, and 2cyanoacetic acid were obtained from Aldrich, whereas 5formylthiopheneboronic acid was obtained from Acros Organics. All commercial reagents and solvents were used without further purification. The progress of the reaction was checked by means of thin-layer chromatography on $0.25 \\mathrm{~mm}$ thick precoated silica plates (Merck Fertigplatten Kieselgel 60 F254); the spots were visualized using UV light. Silica gel column chromatography (Merck Kieselgel, 230-400 mesh) was used in the purification of the compounds. NMR spectra were performed on a Bruker Avance II 400 (working frequency of $400 \\mathrm{MHz}$ for ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ and $100.6 \\mathrm{MHz}$ for ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ ), and the solvent peak was used as the internal reference. The solvents are specified in parenthesis before the chemical shifts values $(\\delta$ relative to tetramethylsilane). Peak assignments were obtained by comparison of chemical shifts, peak multiplicities, and $J$ values and were sustained by spin decoupling-double resonance and bidimensional heteronuclear multiple bond correlation and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence techniques. Infrared spectra were obtained on a Bomem MB 104 spectrophotometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV/2501PC spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer, and relative fluorescence quantum yields were determined using the reference standard fluorescein in $0.1 \\mathrm{M}$ aqueous solution of $\\mathrm{NaOH}\\left(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{F}}=0.79\\right)^{72}$ or 9,10 diphenylanthracene in ethanol. ${ }^{73}$ Melting points were determined on a Gallenkamp machine. Mass spectra analysis was performed at the C.A.C.T.I.-Unidad de Espectrometria de Masas of the University of Vigo, Spain. The experimental procedures for the synthesis of precursor $2, N, N$-diphenylhidrazone derivatives $\\mathbf{3 a}-\\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{7} \\mathbf{c}$, aldehydes $\\mathbf{4 a}-\\mathbf{b}$, the final pushpull cyanoacetic acid $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathbf{b}$, and dicyanovinyl derivatives $\\mathbf{6} \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ are described in the Supporting Information.\n\n4.2. Cyclic Voltammetry. Autolab PGSTAT302N was used for electrochemical measurements. The measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell. Glassy carbon served as the working electrode, Pt was as the counter-electrode, and the reference was $\\mathrm{Ag} / \\mathrm{AgCl}$. Solutions were prepared using dry dimethylformamide (DMF). Concentrations of the dyes were $1 \\mathrm{mM}$. $\\left[\\mathrm{NBu}_{4}\\right]\\left[\\mathrm{BF}_{4}\\right](0.1 \\mathrm{M})$ was added to achieve sufficient conductivity. All solutions were deaerated by bubbling of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$. As an internal redox reference, $\\mathrm{Fc}^{+} / \\mathrm{Fc}$ was used. $^{42,74}$\n\n4.3. NLO Measurements. The orientationally averaged first hyperpolarizability $\\beta$ of the push-pull chromophores 4-7 was characterized by measuring the intensity of $\\mathrm{HRS}$ provoked by incident $\\mathrm{q}$-switched laser pulses with a pulse duration of approximately $12 \\mathrm{~ns}$ and an energy of $2 \\mathrm{~mJ}$. The experimental setup has been previously described ${ }^{31,38}$ and is based on the pioneering work of Clays and Persoons, ${ }^{50}$ (see Supporting Information for further details).\n\n4.4. Preparation and Characterization of DSSCs. DSSCss were prepared as described in the Supporting Information. The photovoltaic performance was obtained with an Oriel Class solar simulator and a ZENNIUM workstation, using a metal mask with an aperture area of $0.25 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, as previously reported. ${ }^{42}$ (See Supporting Information for further details).\n\n4.5. Computational Studies. DFT calculations were used to obtain the geometries and optoelectronic properties of the dyes $\\mathbf{5 a}, \\mathbf{5 b}$, and $7 \\mathbf{c}$. The geometries of the free dyes were optimized with the B3LYP exchange correlation functional (combination of the hybrid exchange functional of Becke ${ }^{75}$ together with the correlation functional $\\left.\\mathrm{LYP}^{76}\\right)$, using the allelectron 6-31G $(\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{p})$ double- $\\zeta$ plus polarization basis sets for all atoms. No symmetry constrains were imposed and the polarizable continuum $\\operatorname{model}^{77,78}$ was used to account for the effects of chloroform as the bulk solvent. The molecular structures of the most stable conformers of the dyes were also optimized with the CAM-B3LYP ${ }^{79}$ functional. The harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated to assess the nature of the optimized stationary points found in the potential energy surface and all were confirmed to be true minima (i.e., with no imaginary frequencies). The properties of the dye $\\mathbf{5 a}$ adsorbed to a $\\left(\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\right)_{9}$ cluster were also calculated. The initial geometry for the $\\left(\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\right)_{9}$ cluster was obtained from previous theoretical studies. ${ }^{80,81}$ This structure was then optimized using the B3LYP functional and the Los Alamos effective core potential plus double- $\\zeta$ basis set $(\\mathrm{LANL} 2 \\mathrm{DZ})^{82-84}$ on titanium and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for oxygen. The same computational procedure was used to optimize the geometry of the dye/ $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ combined system. TD-DFT calculations were carried out to analyze the absorption spectral properties of the free dyes and of the dye/ $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ system and also to calculate the vertical excitation energies for the lowest singlet excited states of the systems. The CAM-B3LYP ${ }^{79}$ functional and the 6-311G $(\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{p})$ triple- $\\zeta$ plus polarization basis sets were used in these calculations. The bulk solvent effects of chloroform were also considered in the TD-DFT calculations. All calculations were carried out using the GAMESS-US code. ${ }^{85}$\n\n\\section{ASSOCIATED CONTENT}\n\\section{(S) Supporting Information}\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b01045.\n\nSynthesis and characterization of compounds 3-6 and $7 \\mathbf{c}$; experimental procedures concerning the synthesis; NLO measurements; preparation and evaluation of the performance of DSSCs and figures of optimized geometries and relative energies of the minima for dyes 5a, 5b, and 7c [DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)]; and photocurrent-voltage curves of the cells assembled using dyes $\\mathbf{5 a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{7 c}(\\mathrm{PDF})$\n\n\\section{AUTHOR INFORMATION}\n\\section{Corresponding Author}\n*E-mail: \\href{mailto:mfox@quimica.uminho.pt}{mfox@quimica.uminho.pt}.
