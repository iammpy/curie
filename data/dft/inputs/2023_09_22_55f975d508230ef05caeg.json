The exchange-correlation potential was treated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the structural properties. Moreover, the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) approximation was also employed for the electronic properties. The calculated lattice constants are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results. The elastic constants and their derived moduli reveal that $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is ductile and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is brittle in nature. The band structure and the density of states calculations with $\\mathrm{mBJ}$-GGA predict a metallic nature for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and an insulating behavior for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$. The optical properties reveal that both $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ are suitable as wave reflectance compounds in the whole spectrum for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and in the far ultraviolet region (FUV) for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$.\n\\end{abstract}\n\nKeywords: perovskite; elastic properties; optical properties; FP-LAPW; mBJ\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nPerovskite structure solids are of great interest in materials science due to their simple crystal structure and their different unique properties such as ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, thermoelectricity and colossal magneto resistance [1]. Recently, many experimental and theoretical works have been devoted to perovskite oxides $\\mathrm{RE}-\\mathrm{TM}-\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ (RE represents rare earth and TM represents transition metal elements) [2-4].\n\n$\\mathrm{SrTMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{TM}=\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Zr})$ compounds crystallize in the cubic perovskite structure with space group of space $\\mathrm{Pm}_{3}-3 m$ (\\# 221). SrTMO 3 can be described as $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{O}^{-2}$ ions forming a cubic close packed lattice with TM $(\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Ti})$ ions occupying the octahedral holes created by the oxygen. The perovskite structure has a three-dimensional net of corner sharing [ $\\mathrm{TMO}_{6}$ ] octahedral with $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions in the 12 -fold cavities in between the polyhedral [5]. The Sr atom (alkaline earth or rare earth element) is located at $(0,0,0)$, the TM atom (transition metal) at $(1 / 2,1 / 2,1 / 2)$ and the oxygen atoms sit at face centered positions $(1 / 2,1 / 2,0),(0,1 / 2,1 / 2)$ and $(1 / 2,0,1 / 2)$. A large number of metallic elements are stable in the perovskite structure, if the tolerance factor $t$ is in the range of 0.75-1.0 [6].\n\nThe elastic, electronic and optical properties of some perovskite compounds were examined by many researchers [7-10]. In 1992, Roosmalen et al. studied the structure of $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ [9]. In 2009, Baudali et al. [10] computed the structural, optical, electronic and thermal properties of $\\mathrm{SrTiO}_{3}$ pervoskite cubic structure by using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method integrated in Wien $2 \\mathrm{k}$ code [11]. In 2011, Daga et al. [12] used the first principle study to calculate the lattice constant of the cubic $\\mathrm{SrMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{M}=\\mathrm{Ti}, \\mathrm{Zr}$, Mo, $\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Ru})$. They found the lattice constants of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ to be $3.932 \\AA$ and $4.076 \\AA$ A, respectively.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, Ali and Rahaman [13,14] used the pseudo potential method integrated in CASTEP code [15] to study the structural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of $\\operatorname{SrTMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{TM}=\\mathrm{Rh}$, Mo, Ti, Zr, V) compounds of cubic perovskite. They predicted that $\\mathrm{SrTiO}_{3}, \\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrVO}_{3}$ have a brittle nature, while $\\mathrm{SrMoO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ have a ductile nature. Moreover, they concluded that $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ has the highest dielectric constant compared to the other compounds.\n\n$\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound (with $4 d$-electrons) is of interest because of its high temperature electronic properties applications such as hydrogen gas sensors and fuel cells. $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ with high perfection can be grown and used as laser-host materials. Shende et al. [16] suggested that these materials can be used in high-voltage capacitor applications because of their high breakdown strengths and high dielectric constant. $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ satisfies the conditions for having significant quantum critical fluctuations [17]. A non-Fermi-liquid behavior in transport properties should be observed in $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ in the range where quantum magnetic fluctuations are active [17]. Considering the heaviness of the band structure, these should be observed in transport [17]. Pseudo gap formation, metal-insulator transitions and high-voltage applications are the other significant properties which draw a considerable attention to $4 d$ TMO. To the best of our knowledge, no ab initio investigations of the optical properties of these compounds have been reported and no experimental work on the electronic, elastic and optical properties have been studied too.\n\nIn the present work, we have studied the structural, electronic, elastic and optical properties of $\\mathrm{SrTMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{TM}=\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Zr})$ by using FP-LAPW (all electron method) method. The motivation of this work is to improve the calculations and to provide some additional information to the features of $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compounds using the all electron method (FP-LAPW).\n\n\\section{Computational Details}\nThe computation has been performed by using FP-LAPW method integrated in Wien2k code [11]. In this method, the unit cell is partitioned into two types of regions: (i) atomic-centered muffin-tin (MT) spheres with radius $R_{\\alpha}$; and (ii) the remaining interstitial region [18]. The expansion of spherical harmonics is defined within a muffin-tin sphere of radius $R_{\\mathrm{MT}}$ around each nucleus. The Muffin-Tin radius $R_{\\mathrm{MT}}$ values used are $2.5,1.95,1.67$ atomic units (a.u) for $\\mathrm{Sr}$, $\\mathrm{Rh}$ and $\\mathrm{O}$ atoms for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound and 2.5, $1.8$ and $1.5$ a.u for $\\mathrm{Sr}, \\mathrm{Zr}$ and $\\mathrm{O}$ atoms for the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound. The plane wave cut-off parameter $R_{\\mathrm{MT}} \\times K_{\\max }$ is equal to 8 . The cut-off energy to separate the core states from valence states is set to be $-9$ Ry. Inside the sphere, Fourier expanded up to $G_{\\max }=14$ with a cut-off $l_{\\max }=12$ and 35 k-points in the irreducible Brillion zone with a grid of $10 \\times 10 \\times 10$ Monkhorst-Pack meshes [19] (equivalent to $1000 \\mathrm{k}$ points in full Brillion zone) which are used to obtain self-consistency for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compounds to be better than $0.1 \\mathrm{mRy}$. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof-generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) is used for the exchange correlation potential [20], while the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ-GGA) [21] is also used to improve the energy band gap of the herein studied compounds.\n\n\\section{Results and Discussions}\n\\subsection{Structural Properties}\nStrontium Transition metal oxides $\\left(\\mathrm{SrTMO}_{3}\\right)$ crystallize in the $\\mathrm{ABO}_{3}$ cubic perovskite structure with the space group Pm-3m (221). The crystal structure of $\\operatorname{SrTMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{TM}=\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Zr})$ is shown in Figure 1 . We have optimized the lattice parameters (a) of these compounds by minimizing the total energy. The total energy at different unit cell volumes for $\\operatorname{SrTMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{TM}=\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Zr})$ is shown in Figure 2, the volume versus energy is fitted to the Murnaghan equation of state [22] to estimate the ground-state properties of these compounds such as the lattice constant $(a)$, the bulk modulus $(B)$ and the pressure derivatives of the bulk modulus $\\left(B^{\\prime}\\right)$. These obtained values are listed in Table 1 together with the available experimental and theoretical data for comparison. In general, the computed structural parameters are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical data available in the literature. More precisely, the lattice parameters of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ are found to be $3.976 \\AA$ and $4.176 \\AA$, respectively. The present calculations show that the lattice parameter of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}\\right)$ is $1.43 \\%$ (1.63\\%) larger than the experimental value [23,24]. This guarantees the reliability of the present first-principles computations for the lattice parameters of these compounds using the PBE-GGA method. The calculated bulk modulus for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is $2.11 \\%$ larger than the experimental value [25].\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-03_810_1383_754_1308}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure 1.

The calculated band structures along the high symmetry lines in Brillion-zone of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ at zero pressure using PBE-GGA approximation [20] are depicted in Figure 3, where the Fermi level is set at zero eV. In $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$, the valence band maximum (VBM) occurs along the M-point symmetry line, while the conduction band minimum occurs along the $\\Gamma$-point symmetry line with energy band gap $3.69 \\mathrm{eV}$, resulting in an indirect energy band gap (M-\u0413) semiconductor.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-04_735_1595_341_1029}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-04_737_1593_1048_1710}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3. Band structure of cubic pervoskite using PBE-GGA method for (a) $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and (b) $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compounds.\n\nThe calculated energy band gap is tabulated in Table 2 along with the available previous theoretical value [26]. The calculated energy gap is larger than the theoretical value by $0.32 \\mathrm{eV}$ [26]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental value available to compare with. The usual trend of the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ-GGA) method is enlarging the energy band gap values $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$ of the semiconductor and insulator materials which makes $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$ comparable to the experimental results [21]. The band structures of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compounds using mBJ-GGA are displayed in Figure 4. For the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound, the minimum energy gap within mBJ-GGA is still indirect with the same direction as the PBE-GGA approach, but its value increases by about $0.85 \\mathrm{eV}$ to become $4.54 \\mathrm{eV}$. $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is classified as an insulator within the mBJ-GGA method. $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ has a metallic nature with no energy gap within the two approaches PBE-GGA and mBJ-GGA.\n\nTable 2.

In $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$, the valence band originates from O- $p$ and Rh- $d$ states. The maximum contribution of the Rh- $d$ state is near the Fermi level. In the conduction band, the bands are due to the Sr- $d$ with a small contribution from Rh- $d$, O- $p$ and O-s states. In SrZrO3, the valence band originates from O- $p$ with few contribution from $\\mathrm{Zr}-d, p$ and Sr- $d$ states. In the conduction band, the bands are due to $\\mathrm{Zr}-d$ and Sr- $d$ states with a small contribution from O- $p$ states.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-05_1739_2190_317_894}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-05_1735_2194_1161_1740}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.

Critic is a full-edged program for the topological analysis of solid-state electron densities.\n\nThis program uses the quantum theory of atom in molecule (QTAIM) to make a topological analysis of the electronic density $(\\varrho)$ of a crystal. By means of QTAIM, we can automatically locate all critical points $\\left(\\mathrm{CP}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{s}\\right)$ of the electronic density rising from a nil flux of the electron density gradient condition [27]. The procedure implemented in critic is to divide $\\varrho$ into disjoint regions $\\Omega$ (basins) through the real space approaches. Here, we can generate topological schemes in two or tridimensional plots. It is clearly shown from the topological distribution of the charge density in Figure 7A, that the charge distribution in the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound is spherically symmetrical. This suggests that all electronic charges are localized around anions-a typical ionic bonding. The same trend is also displayed for the second compound with some small difference in the distribution of $\\varrho$ due to the charge transfer, which differs in the two titled compounds (see Figure 7C). We also present in Figure 7B,D, the molecular graph of our two perovskites.\n\nThese plots were done following the character of Wyckoff's, bond CP and ring CP family [28]. The form of the atomic basin generated by the CCP point suggests that both $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ are belonging to the R11 family (see Figure 7B,D) [28]. Here, we can define a topological charge of each atomic basin. As results, $Q(\\mathrm{Sr})=1.59$ electron, $Q(\\mathrm{Rh})=1.47$ electron and $Q(\\mathrm{O})=-1.05$ electron for SrRhO $_{3}$, and $Q(\\mathrm{Sr})=1.61$ electron, $Q(\\mathrm{Zr})=2.49$ electron and $Q(\\mathrm{O})=-1.37$ electron for the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound. When we compare these charges with the oxidation number corresponding to each of the atoms, we find that the charge transfer is mainly due to the strontium one, with an equal percentage of $80 \\%$ in both perovskites. However, we note that replacing the cation $\\mathrm{Rh}$ with electro-negativity of $2.2$ by the $\\mathrm{Zr}$ one with low electro-negativity of $1.4$ has a negligible effect on the nature of the bonding. The $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ has a more ionic trend. However, even the constituent cations show different charge transfer $(\\mathrm{Zr}$ and $\\mathrm{Rh}$ are transferred by $62 \\%$ and $37 \\%)$ and each of them varies as strongly as the oxide ions. The latter adapt their charges according to electro-neutrality requirements. There is a second topological index that has been proposed as a global measurement of the degree of metallicity, the electron density flatness defined as $f=\\frac{\\rho_{c}^{\\min }}{\\rho_{b}^{\\max }}$ where $\\rho_{c}^{\\min }$ is the minimal electron density found on the unit cell (it necessarily corresponds to a critical point) and $\\rho_{b}^{\\max }$ is the maximal electron density among bond critical points. This flatness has values close to one on common metallic compounds and close to zero on localized bonding compounds [29]. The delocalization of electrons (flatness) in the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compounds are respectively equal to $80.61 \\%$ and $5.62 \\%$. This suggests that the global chemical behavior of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is metallic, whereas $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is nonmetallic. To go further in the characterization of the bonds nature of the titled compounds we have employed another tool named the electron localization function (ELF) [30], which is based on a measure of the likelihood of finding an electron in the neighborhood space of a reference electron located at a given point and with the same spin. Taking into account that the homogeneous electron gas has an ELF value of $0.5$, valence electrons of metals should deviate very slightly from this quantity. The ELF isosurfaces, as well as the one-dimensional projections of $\\mathrm{Sr}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Rh}$ and $\\mathrm{Sr}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Zr}$ bond paths of the investigated perovskites are depicted in Figure 8. It is strikingly clear from the plot that $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Zr}$ and $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Rh}$ are different. The integration of population on the ELF attractor of the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound shows two types of $\\mathrm{Zr}-\\mathrm{O}$ bonds, the first one has ELF maxima equal to $0.78$ and the second to $0.83$; the former has the negligible population, but the latter has $0.95$ electrons. The integration gives a number of the delocalized attractor as lone pair bonds around the $\\mathrm{Sr}$ and $\\mathrm{Zr}$ cations; the population in this attractor varies from $1.4$ to $1.1$ electrons. Regarding the second compound $\\left(\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}\\right)$, no $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Rh}$ bonds have been found, only delocalized lone pair ones with ELF maxima near to $0.5$ are reported. Here, we should emphasize that the delocalization of these attractors in the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound provides a reliable measure of the delocalization of wave function and its localization in the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-08_320_1260_340_1720}\n\nFigure 7. 2D map of topological analysis of electron density of (A) $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ and (C) $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}, \\mathrm{molecular}^{2}$ graph representation of $\\mathbf{( B )} \\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ and (D) $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$.

These constants define the properties of material that undergo stress, deform and then recover, returning to its original shape after stress ceases. They have a significant role in finding information about the brittleness, ductility, stiffness and the mechanical stability of the material [31]. The elastic constants require knowledge of the derivative of the energy as a function of the lattice strain. In the case of the cubic system, this strain is chosen in such a way that the volume of the unit cell is preserved. Thus, for the calculation of elastic constants $C_{11}, C_{12}$ and $C_{44}$, for these compounds we have used the method developed by Morteza Jamal [32] and integrated in Wien2k code as the IRelast package (Cubic-elastic\\_13.2). The calculated $C_{\\mathrm{ij}}$ constants are listed in Table 3. Our computed $C_{\\mathrm{ij}}$ data are in reasonable agreement with previous theoretical results. In view of Table 3 , it can be noticed that the calculated values of the elastic modulus $C_{11}$, which are related to the unidirectional compression along the principal crystallographic directions, are much higher than that of $C_{44}$, which represent the resistance to the shear deformation, indicating the weak resistance to the shear deformation compared to the resistance to the unidirectional compression. The mechanical stability of a cubic material requires that its independent elastic constants should satisfy the following Born's stability criteria [33,34]:\n\n\\[\nC_{11}>0 ; C_{44}>0 ; C_{11}+2 C_{12}>0 ; C_{11}>B>C_{12}\n\\]\n\nFrom Table 3, we can see that all required conditions given in the above Equation (1) are simultaneously satisfied, which clearly indicates that the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ are mechanically stable.\n\nThe three elastic constants $C_{11}, C_{12}$ and $C_{44}$ are estimated from first-principles calculations for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ single-crystals. However, the prepared materials are in general polycrystalline, and therefore it is important to evaluate the corresponding moduli for the polycrystalline species using the Hill's approach [35]. In this approach, the effective modulus for polycrystals could be approximated by the arithmetic mean of the two well-known bounds for monocrystals according to Voigt [36] and Reuss [37]. Then, for the cubic system, the shear modulus $S$ in the mentioned approximations: Voigt $(V)$, Reuss $(R)$ and Hill $(H)$ are calculated from the elastic constants of the single crystal, in the following form:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nS_{\\mathrm{V}}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left(C_{11}-C_{12}+3 C_{44}\\right) \\\\\nS_{\\mathrm{R}}=\\frac{5 C_{44}\\left(C_{11}-C_{12}\\right)}{4 C_{44}+3\\left(C-C_{12}\\right)} \\\\\nS_{\\mathrm{H}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{V}}+S_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nTo compute the Young's modulus $(Y)$, Poisson's ratio $(v)$, and the anisotropic factor $(A)$, the following equations are used, respectively:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nY=\\frac{9 S_{\\mathrm{H}} B}{\\left(S_{\\mathrm{H}}+3 B\\right)} \\\\\nv=\\frac{3 B-2 S_{\\mathrm{H}}}{2\\left(3 B+S_{\\mathrm{H}}\\right)} \\\\\nA=\\frac{2 C_{44}}{C_{11}-C_{12}}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nThe computed bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and anisotropic factor are listed in Table 3 along with the theoretical results [14,38]. The bulk modulus and shear modulus can be used to measure the material hardness [39]. In general, when $S_{H}$ values increase, the materials become stiffer. From the obtained values of shear modulus $S_{\\mathrm{H}}$ one can remark that $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is stiffer than $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$.\n\nTable 3.

According to Pugh [40], a high $B / S$ value is associated with ductility, while a low value is consistent with brittleness. The critical value that separates the two behaviors has been determined to be 1.75. The results listed in Table 3 clearly indicate that the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}\\right)$ compound has $B / S_{\\mathrm{H}}$ ratio higher (smaller) than the critical value of $1.75$, which classifies $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}\\right)$ compound as ductile (brittle) material. In addition, to identify the materials as ductile or brittle, we also applied the Cauchy's pressure rule defined as the difference between the elastic constants $C_{12}-C_{44}$ [41]. According to this rule, if the Cauchy's pressure is positive (negative), the material will be ductile (brittle) in nature. As shown in Table 3, It is seen that the Cauchy's pressure is positive for SrRhO ${ }_{3}$ and negative for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$, confirming the ductile nature for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and the brittle behavior for the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound. We may also refer to Frantsevich et al. [42] who distinguishes the ductility and brittleness of materials in terms of Poisson's ratio $(v)$. According to this rule, if the Poisson's ratio is less than $0.26$, the material will be brittle in nature; otherwise, the material will be ductile. As shown, the computed Poisson's ratiosare $0.30$ for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $0.23$ for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$, categorizing $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ as brittle compounds and $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ as ductile compounds. These results exactly agree with the results of the $B / S$ ratio and Cauchy's pressure.\n\nThe anisotropy factor is an important parameter to measure the degree of materials anisotropy; also, it has a significant usage in engineering science to inspect the potential of micro-cracks in the material [43,44]. For completely isotropic materials, the anisotropy factor $A$ takes the value of the unity and the deviation from unity measures the degree of elastic anisotropy. The calculated values of the anisotropic factor $A$ are found to be equal to $1.85$ for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ and $0.71$ for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$, suggesting that both compounds are anisotropic in nature and $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is characterized by a profound anisotropy.\n\n\\subsection{Optical Properties}\nSince the investigated compounds have cubic symmetry, we need to calculate only one dielectric tensor component to completely characterize their linear optical properties. The frequency-dependent complex dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\omega)=\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)+i \\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$; where $\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)$ and $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ are the real and imaginary components of the dielectric function, respectively; is known to describe the optical response of the medium at all photon energies $E=\\hbar \\omega$, using the formalism of Ehrenreich and Cohen [45].\n\nComplex dielectric function can be derived from the definition given by Hedin [46]\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon\\left(r, t, r^{\\prime}, t^{\\prime}\\right)=\\delta\\left(r-r^{\\prime}\\right) \\delta\\left(t-t^{\\prime}\\right)-\\int P\\left(r, t, r^{\\prime \\prime}, t^{\\prime}\\right) v\\left(r^{\\prime \\prime}-r^{\\prime}\\right) d r^{\\prime \\prime}\n\\]\n\nwhere $P$ is the polarization propagator and is the Coulomb interaction; $P$ can be given by the following form:\n\n\\[\nP(\\omega, q)=\\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{n^{\\prime}, n, k} \\frac{f_{0}\\left(\\varepsilon_{n, k+q}\\right)-f_{0}\\left(\\varepsilon_{n^{\\prime}, k}\\right)}{\\varepsilon_{n, k+q}-\\varepsilon_{n^{\\prime}, k}-W}\\left|M_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k, q)\\right|^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere $V$ is the unit cell volume, $f_{0}$ is the Fermi distribution function and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{k}}$ is the single particle energy. The matrix element can be given by: $M_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k, q)=\\left\\langle u_{n k}\\left|\\mathrm{e}^{-i q, r}\\right| u_{n^{\\prime} k}\\right\\rangle, q$ is the wave vector of light and it is much smaller than the wave vector of electrons in the system; the matrix elements $M_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k, q)$ with small $q$ can be given by:\n\n\\[\nM_{m, n}(k, 0)=\\delta_{l, n}-\\left(\\delta_{l, n}-1\\right) \\frac{h P_{m, n, k}}{2 \\pi\\left(\\varepsilon_{n, k}-\\varepsilon_{m, k}\\right)} q\n\\]\n\nThe sum over $n^{\\prime}$ and $n$ must be split into two terms, one with $n^{\\prime}=n$ corresponding to intra-band electronic transitions, and the second with $n^{\\prime} \\neq n$, corresponding to inter-band transitions, the intra-band part of the dielectric function $\\epsilon(\\omega, 0)$ can be given by:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon^{\\text {intra }}(\\omega, 0)=1-\\lim _{q \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{4 \\pi \\mathrm{e}^{2}}{V|q|^{2}} \\sum_{n, k} \\frac{f_{0}\\left(\\varepsilon_{n, k+q}\\right)-f_{0}\\left(\\varepsilon_{n, k}\\right)}{\\varepsilon_{n, k+q}-\\varepsilon_{n, k}-\\omega}\\left|M_{n, n}(k, q)\\right|^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhile the inter band part can be written as\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon^{\\text {inter }}(\\omega, 0)=-\\lim _{q \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{4 \\pi \\mathrm{e}^{2}}{V|q|^{2}} \\sum_{n, n^{\\prime}, k} \\frac{f_{0}\\left(\\varepsilon_{n^{\\prime}, k+q}\\right)-f_{0}\\left(\\varepsilon_{n, k}\\right)}{\\varepsilon_{n^{\\prime}, k+q}-\\varepsilon_{n, k}-\\omega}\\left|M_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k, q)\\right|^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere $n^{\\prime} \\neq n$ in Equation (10).\n\nThe imaginary part of the $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ in the long wavelength limit has been obtained directly from the electronic structure calculation, using the joint density of states (JDOS) and the transition moments elements $M_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k, q)$ :\n\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)=\\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{2} \\hbar}{\\pi m^{2} \\omega^{2}} \\sum_{v, c} \\int_{B Z}\\left|M_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k, q)\\right|^{2} \\delta\\left[\\omega_{n, n^{\\prime}}(k)-\\omega\\right] d^{3} k\n\\]\n\nThe integral is over the first Brillouin zone. The real part of $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ can be derived from the imaginary part using the Kramers-Kronig relations.\n\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)=1+\\frac{2}{\\pi} P \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\omega^{\\prime} \\varepsilon_{2}\\left(\\omega^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\omega^{\\prime}-\\omega^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} \\omega^{\\prime}\n\\]\n\nwhere $P$ implies the principal value of the integral. The knowledge of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function allows the calculation of other important optical functions such as the refractive index $n(\\omega)$, reflectivity $R(\\omega)$, extinction coefficient $k(\\omega)$, energy loss function $L(\\omega)$ and absorption coefficient $\\alpha(\\omega)$ by using the following expressions [47-49]:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nn(\\omega)= & \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{1}^{2}(\\omega)+\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega)}+\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)\\right]\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\nR(\\omega)= & \\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon(\\omega)}-1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon(\\omega)}+1}\\right|^{2}=\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{1}+i \\varepsilon_{2}}-1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{1}+i \\varepsilon_{2}}+1}\\right|^{2} \\\\\nk(\\omega)= & \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{1}^{2}(\\omega)+\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega)}-\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)\\right]\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\n& L(\\omega)=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)}{\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)^{2}+\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\alpha(\\omega)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\omega}{c}\\left(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{1}^{2}(\\omega)+\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega)}-\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\nReal and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant are displayed in Figure $9 \\mathrm{a}-\\mathrm{d}$ for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound. The value of the static real part of the dielectric function $\\varepsilon_{1}(0)$ for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound within intra and inter band transition in Figure $9 \\mathrm{a}$ is negative, while the imaginary part of the static dielectric function $\\varepsilon_{2}(0)$ within intra and inter band transition Figure $9 \\mathrm{c}$ is positive; this implies two important facts: Firstly, the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound has considerable metallic behavior, which agrees with the energy band structure calculations. Secondly, the negative value of $\\left(\\varepsilon_{1}\\right)$ especially in the energy range $0-1.15 \\mathrm{eV}$ in Figure $9 \\mathrm{a}$ and the highly positive value of $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ at the early beginning of Figure 9c, reveal the loss of light transit. Real dielectric constant within intra band transition for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ in Figure $9 \\mathrm{~b}$ has small peaks; the first two of them are centered at $1.42 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $3.73 \\mathrm{eV}$. We see that $\\left(\\varepsilon_{1}\\right)$ for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound in Figure $9 \\mathrm{a}$, it has roots in the $1.15 \\mathrm{eV}, 1.55 \\mathrm{eV}, 5.0 \\mathrm{eV}, 8.45 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $13.5 \\mathrm{eV}$. When these roots occur, $\\left(\\varepsilon_{1}\\right)=0$, the compound does not respond to incident light, this fact is mainly due to the Plasmon oscillation. The sharp increase in $\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)$ with intra and inter band transition, in Figure $9 \\mathrm{a}$, at an energy range $0-1.15 \\mathrm{eV}$, indicates that the compound does not interact with the incident photons at this energy range. The static dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{1}(0)$ of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ with inter $+$ intra in Figure $9 \\mathrm{a}$ and intra band transition Figure $9 \\mathrm{~b}$ are $-180$ and 32, respectively. Negative value $\\varepsilon_{1}(0)$ of with inter + intra band transition ensures the metallic behavior of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound. By taking only the intra band transition into account as seen in Figure $9 b$, d, both the real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant have positive values, which indicates a mix of metallic and semiconducting behavior for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound. This implies that for metallic compounds inter and intra band transitions must be taken into account.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-12_1395_1878_292_1033}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-12_1916_2373_291_1034}\n\\end{center}\n\n(c)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-12_1415_1875_1067_1760}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-12_1912_2371_1065_1779}\n\\end{center}\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 9. The dielectric function of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound: (a,b) Real part; (c,d) Imaginary part.\n\nOptical conductivity is a quantity depending on the inter band and intra band transitions. In Figure 10a,b, the real and imaginary parts of conductivity are illustrated for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound, by taking the inter and intra band transition into account; the static real conductivity is high, while it is zero when only intra band transition is taken into account. As the incident light energy increases, the real and imaginary parts of conductivity with the two approaches; intra + inter and intra band transition; both almost have the same behavior.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-13_481_958_320_1034}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-13_481_958_1068_1736}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 10. The conductivity function of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound: (a) Real part; (b) Imaginary part.\n\nThe refractive index $n(\\omega)$ and extinct factor $k(\\omega)$ for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound are illustrated in Figure 11a,b and Figure 12a,b, respectively. The $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ has a high $n(0)$ and $k(0)$ with intra and inter band transition, which indicates metallic behavior for the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric. As the incident light energy increases the $n(\\omega)$; and $k(\\omega)$ goes to a lower values. Many peaks are shown in $n(\\omega)$ and $k(\\omega)$ spectra, these peaks originate from intra-band transition. The extinction coefficient depends on the amount of absorption of the photon when it propagates in the material, while the refractive index indicates the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-13_1488_1910_338_1009}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-13_1488_1910_1029_1735}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11.

(a) Extinct factor $k(\\omega)$ within inter and intra; (b) Extinct factor $k(\\omega)$ within intra for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound. The reflectivity spectra of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ as a function of energy are shown in Figure 13a. The static reflectivity of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ within intra and inter transition is $0.95$, while it is $0.5$ within intra transition. The reflectivity of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ in the low energy region goes down as the incident light energy increases, while it increases in the high energy region-the far ultraviolet region (FUV). The absorption coefficient spectra of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is plotted in Figure 13b, absorption spectra, as shown, begins at the early beginning and increases as the incident photon energy increases with some peaks along the spectrum. The observed peaks in the spectra related to electron transitions from conduction to valence bands, sharp peaks in the absorption spectrum may be accordance with transitions between valance and conduction band (inter band transitions) that can be considerably far from each other. The $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound is a good absorbent compound because it is a metal compound and it is identical with intra + inter and intra band transition. Peaks in the spectrum of the absorption coefficient are proportional to the peaks in the $\\left(\\varepsilon_{2}\\right)$ spectrum. The energy loss function $L(\\omega)$ is describing the energy loss of the fast electrons that propagate inside the material. The energy loss spectrum of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is depicted in Figure 13c. Energy loss for $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is high along the whole spectrum and it is identical with intra $+$ inter and intra band transition in the high energy region. We observe some peaks, the highest peaks are related to the plasma frequency [50]. From these Figures, the plasma frequency of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ occurs at $10.9 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $13.2 \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-14_1138_1592_384_1004}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-14_1146_1595_1047_1672}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-14_1628_2096_684_1372}\n\\end{center}\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 13.

It is seen that the calculated linear optical components $\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)$ and $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ spectra for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ are different from $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$. The calculated $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ spectra show that the first critical point (threshold energy) of the dielectric function occurs at about $4.52 \\mathrm{eV}$ within the mBJ approach (GGA: $3.6 \\mathrm{eV}$ ) for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$; the first critical points are comparable with the energy band gap computed from the energy band structure. We can see from Figure 14b, that $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ displaced to the high energy region within the $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ approach, but the first peak in $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ within the GGA approach has a higher value. The threshold's energy is followed by some peaks that originate from direct optical transition between the valence band and conduction bands. The main peak in the absorptive spectra is positioned at about $7.2 \\mathrm{eV}$ within $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ (GGA: $6.2 \\mathrm{eV}$ ). The real part $\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)$ gives us information about the material's polarizability; the static dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{1}(0)$ of $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is 3 within the $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ approach (GGA: 3.92), as we can see that the $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ approach has a lower value of $\\varepsilon_{1}(0)$. The value of $\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)$ within $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ displaced to the higher energy region along the spectrum. The behavior with the high dielectric constant makes $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ a possible useful candidate for manufacturing high capacitors [51]. The negative value in the spectra of $\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)$ for the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound is located only in the ultraviolet spectrum; and shows the metallic behavior of this compound in the mentioned region.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-15_714_1159_337_1028}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-15_728_1156_1052_1735}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 14.

It can be seen from Figure 15a, that the real part of conductivity starts to have considerable values at about $4.75 \\mathrm{eV}$ within the $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ approach (GGA: $3.6 \\mathrm{eV}$ ). From the conductivity and imaginary part of the dielectric function spectrums (Figure 14b), it is shown that both of them start to have a considerable value from approximately the same value. We have also observed some peaks in the conductivity spectra as also observed in the $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ spectra. The conductivity increases as the material becomes more photon (energy) absorbent.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-15_1718_2189_360_1005}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-15_1732_2186_1022_1696}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 15.

We can clearly see that $k(\\omega)$, conductivity and $\\varepsilon_{2}(\\omega)$ start to have considerable values at the same point. Some peaks are presented along the spectrum, these peaks are related to the electrons transitions from valence to conduction bands. It is clearly seen that the extinction coefficient and the imaginary part of the epsilon vary in the same way. The static value of the refractive index $n(0)$ in Figure $16 \\mathrm{~b}$ for the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound is $1.75$ within the mBJ approach (GGA: 1.9), which is a small value compared to $n(0)$ for the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-16_453_861_337_1028}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-16_455_869_1044_1732}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 16. (a) Extinct factor $k(\\omega)$; (b) Refractive index $n(\\omega)$ for $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound using both PBE-GGA and mBJ-GGA methods.\n\nReflectivity, energy loss and absorption functions are illustrated in Figure 17a-c, respectively. The static reflectivity of $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is about $0.07$ within the $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ approach (GGA: 0.11). The static reflectivity of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ is more than nine times greater than the reflectivity of $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$. The reflectivity value increases rapidly in the high energy region; far ultraviolet region (FUV); $a b=n d$ for the $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ compound, indicating that $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is suitable as a wave reflectance compound in the far ultraviolet region (FUV). Energy loss and absorption functions are seen in Figure $17 \\mathrm{~b}$, c; both of them quietly behave in the same way. Both absorption and energy loss for SrZrO3 begin at about $4.8 \\mathrm{eV}$ within the $\\mathrm{mBJ}$ approach (GGA: $3.8 \\mathrm{eV}$ ). The $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is a good absorbent compound, but not in the low energy region; it is good absorbent in the far ultraviolet region, as it shows metallic behavior in the high energy region.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-16_1526_2026_273_1052}\n\\end{center}\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-16_1528_2030_1072_1783}\n\\end{center}\n\n(b)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_55f975d508230ef05caeg-16_2055_2509_594_1468}\n\\end{center}\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 17.

The lattice parameter is found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical results. From the band structure, we found that the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ compound has a metallic nature within both BPE-GGA and mBJ-GGA approaches, while $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ is found to be an insulator within mBJ-GGA, while it is a wide energy band gap semiconductor within PBE-GGA. The elastic constants $\\left(C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{44}\\right)$, bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus are also calculated and discussed. By analyzing the $B / S$ ratio and Poisson's ratio, we found that $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ has a ductile nature, while $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ has brittle nature. $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ has a more ionic trend compared to the $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$. The optical properties such as dielectric constant, absorption coefficient, reflectivity coefficient, refractive index, optical conductivity and energy loss function were investigated in the energy range (0-14) $\\mathrm{eV}$. According to the dielectric constant, $\\mathrm{SrZrO}_{3}$ has a large static dielectric constant which may make it promising as a good dielectric material; while $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ has a negative real dielectric constant which indicates a metallic behavior. It would be interesting to make detailed measurements of the transport and thermodynamic properties of $\\mathrm{SrRhO}_{3}$ under applied fields looking for metamagnetic behavior and non-Fermi-liquid scalings. In conclusion, our theoretical calculations on $\\mathrm{SrTMO}_{3}(\\mathrm{TM}=\\mathrm{Rh}, \\mathrm{Zr})$ will help to use these materials for practical applications.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.A.-J.; Data Curation, A.S., T.O. and A.M.; Formal Analysis, A.S., R.T.J. and T.O.; Investigation, M.A.-J. and R.K.; Methodology, M.A.-J.; Project Administration, M.A.-J.; Supervision, M.A.-J.; Visualization, M.A.-J.; Writing-Original Draft, A.S., T.O. and A.M.; Writing-Review \\& Editing, R.K. and K.F.I.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nAcknowledgments: This work has been carried out in the Computational Physics Laboratory, Physics Department, An-Najah N.
