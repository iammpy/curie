Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we found that in vacuum at room temperature and at low Co coverage, clusters of a few Co atoms\n\\end{abstract}\n\nsubstituting Cu atoms form at the surface. At CO pressures in the Torr range, we found that up to 2.5 CO molecules can bind on a single Co atom, in carbonyl-like configurations. Based on highresolution STM images, together with density function theory calculations, we determined the most stable CuCo cluster structures formed with bound CO. Such carbonyl-like formation manifests in shifts in the binding energy of the Co core-level peaks in x-ray photoelectron spectra, as well as shifts in the vibrational modes of adsorbed CO in infrared reflection absorption spectra. The multiple CO adsorption on a Co site weakens the Co-CO bond and thus reduces the C-O bond scission probability. Our results may explain the different product distribution, including higher selectivity towards alcohol formation, when bimetallic CuCo catalysts are used compared to pure Co.\n\n\\section{INTRODUCTION}\nOur present fundamental understanding of catalyst surfaces has benefited from the use of model single crystals and surface sensitive techniques that work under conditions of ultra-high vacuum (UHV), often performed at cryogenic temperatures. ${ }^{1,2}$ To approach conditions closer to those in practical catalysis research the field has evolved into new directions: One is the use of complex surfaces, such as oxide supports and bimetallic catalysts; another is to operate under gaseous or liquid environments. The latter has been made possible by the development of new microscopy tools such as high pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HPSTM), ${ }^{3-6}$ environmental transmission electron microscopy, x-ray based spectroscopies like ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), ${ }^{7-9}$ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and optical techniques such as infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). ${ }^{10,11}$\n\nUsing combinations of such characterization techniques it was found that even the most compact and stable surfaces could go through substantial structural and chemical changes when in equilibrium with reactant gases. For instance, using HPSTM and APXPS, it was observed that the (111), (100), and (110) faces of Cu break up into nanoclusters at room temperature (RT $298 \\mathrm{~K})$ in the presence of CO gas at pressures above $0.1$ Torr. ${ }^{12-14}$ Density functional theory (DFT), on the other hand, has been a key computational tool for understanding the atomic structures observed by STM and for understanding the energetics of densely covered surfaces at RT and above. ${ }^{12,13}$ Many bimetallic or multi-component alloys have shown very different, and sometimes promising, catalytic activity and selectivity compared to elemental metal catalysts. The tunability of the catalyst composition allows us to further optimize the selectivity towards high value products. ${ }^{15,16}$ For example, copper-cobalt (CuCo) alloys are reported to enhance the selectivity towards oxygenated products in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from syngas $\\left(\\mathrm{CO}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\right),{ }^{17-23}$ while pure Co produces mostly olefins and paraffins. ${ }^{24}$ Bimetallic CuCo systems in the form of single crystals or core-shell nanoparticles have been studied in the past, and the effect of reactant gases in modifying their structure has been demonstrated to a certain extent. ${ }^{25-28}$ However, their atomic structure and chemical state in the presence of gases in the Torr pressure range remains largely unexplored. For that reason we used a model $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ single crystal onto which we evaporated Co to produce a well-defined surface alloy. Here, using HPSTM, APXPS, IRRAS, and DFT we determined the atomic and chemical structure of the bimetallic CuCo surface in the presence of CO in the Torr pressure range.\n\n\\section{EXPERIMENTAL}\nThe experiments were carried in three different experimental systems, each with a UHV preparation chamber containing tools such as Ar ion sputtering for cleaning, metal evaporators, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for thickness monitoring, mass spectrometer, and Auger electron spectrometer (AES). The preparation chamber connects through a gate valve to an analysis/reaction environmental chamber containing either microscopy or a spectroscopy technique. In the first system, the reaction chamber contained a custom-made STM instrument operating both in UHV and in gases at pressures in the Torr to atmospheric range. The second system was devoted to APXPS, at beam line 11.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source, the Berkeley Synchrotron Facility. The third system, located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory was equipped with IRRAS to determine the vibrational structure of adsorbed CO. The same $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ single crystal was used in each system. For each experiment, the CO gas was passed through a $\\mathrm{Ni}$-carbonyl trap at $513 \\mathrm{~K}$ prior to introduction to the chamber, where the initial base pressure was in the low $10^{-10}$ Torr range. In the HPSTM and IRRAS chambers, AES was used to monitor the chemical composition before the experiments and to monitor the Co content of the surface, and again after the experiment to make sure that no Ni contamination had built up on the surface. The pressure, in the Torr range, was measured with a MKS 722A Baratron capacitance pressure gauge. All measurements were performed at RT unless otherwise indicated.\n\nHPSTM imaging was performed using Pt-Ir tips with the bias voltage applied to the sample. ${ }^{4}$ For APXPS experiments photon energies of $1150 \\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\mathrm{Cu} 2 \\mathrm{p}, 1000 \\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\mathrm{Co} 2 \\mathrm{p}, 490$ $\\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\mathrm{C} 1 \\mathrm{~s}$, and $735 \\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\mathrm{O} 1 \\mathrm{~s}$ were used to produce photoelectrons with kinetic energies around $200 \\mathrm{eV}$ in all cases. The peak energies were referred to the Fermi level, measured in the same spectrum at the corresponding photon energy. The IRRA spectra were collected with a resolution of $4 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ at grazing incidence with a commercial Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Bruker, IFS 66v/S)..$^{29}$\n\nThe CuCo surface alloy was prepared as follows: first the Cu(110) surface was cleaned by several cycles of Ar ion sputtering $\\left(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\right.$ Torr, $\\left.1 \\mathrm{kV}, 15 \\mathrm{~min}\\right)$ and annealing to $823 \\mathrm{~K}$ for 10 min. Following the recipe in Ref. ${ }^{30}$, prior to Co deposition a chemisorbed oxygen layer was created on $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ by exposure to 10 Langmuir of $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at $600 \\mathrm{~K}$, followed by 5 min annealing at the same temperature. The role of oxygen is to lower the surface energy for the subsequent growth of Co layers, since the oxygen always resides on the top layer during growth. It also prevents contamination from the background gases. During Co deposition, a CuCo surface alloy is formed as Co displaces $\\mathrm{Cu}$ atoms while alternating metal-oxygen-metal chains of the $(2 \\times 1)$ structure are maintained. Consequently, the surface splits into two levels, the second level made of the aggregated 2D Cu islands with additional Co (Figure S6). The capping oxygen could later be removed by exposure to $0.1$ Torr $\\mathrm{CO}$ at RT. Except where indicated, in most of the experiments reported here the surface population of Co was kept at approximately $20 \\%$ of the surface atoms.\n\n\\section{THEORY}\nTo support the interpretation of the CuCo and adsorbed CO structures we performed firstprinciples calculations within the framework of DFT, using the grid-based projector-augmented wave code GPAW, ${ }^{31}$ with a grid spacing of $0.18 \\AA$. The projected augmented wave (PAW) method was employed to describe the effect of the inner cores of the atoms on the valence electrons. $^{32,33}$ The exchange-correlation energy and potential are described using the generalized gradient approach for the exchange-correlation functional within the Perdew-Wang (PW91) implementation. ${ }^{34,35}$ The metal substrate was modeled by a $(4 \\times 2)$ periodic slab consisting of four (110) atomic planes. An experimental lattice parameter of $3.61 \\AA$ was employed for the $\\mathrm{Cu}$ matrix in all calculations, while the atoms in three outermost atomic layers were allowed to relax. In all the calculations periodic boundary conditions in the $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ directions were employed. Equilibrium nuclear positions were determined by minimization of the acting force in a quasi-Newton scheme until the maximum force was smaller than $0.01 \\mathrm{eV} . \\AA^{-1}$. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a $2 \\times 2 \\times 1$ Monkhorst-Pack grid. The alloy composition was fixed at 6.25\\% Co, equivalent to $0.25$ monolayers (ML) of surface Co atoms.\n\n\\section{RESULTS and DISCUSSION}\n\\subsection{STM and XPS characterization}\nFigure 1a shows an STM image of the initial clean surface in UHV, showing the expected atomic spacing of $\\sim 2.6 \\AA$ and $\\sim 3.6 \\AA$ in the [1-10] and [001] crystallographic directions. A $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)-(2 \\times 1)-\\mathrm{O}$ surface structure was obtained after oxygen adsorption, which consists of $\\mathrm{Cu}-\\mathrm{O}$ chains along the [001] direction (Figure 1b). Figure 1c shows an image after deposition of $0.2$ ML of Co on this surface, where the Co atoms are randomly positioned substituting Cu atoms in the metal-O chains. The expanded area marked with a box, in derivative form, reveals M-O-M $(\\mathrm{M}=\\mathrm{Cu}$ or $\\mathrm{Co})$ chains similar to those in the initial $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)-(2 \\times 1)-\\mathrm{O}$ surface, with varying contrast along the chains due to the higher contrast (i.e., 0.1-0.2 $\\AA$ brighter in the image) of the Co atoms. The islands on top of the terraces contain about $20 \\%$ of all surface atoms, and are composed of Co atoms, and $\\mathrm{Cu}$ atoms displaced from the surface. At higher Co coverage other two- and three-dimensional Co and CuCo clusters are produced (not shown here).\n\nThe removal of $\\mathrm{O}$ from this surface by reaction with $\\mathrm{CO}$ at $\\mathrm{RT}$ was followed by APXPS as a\n\nfunction of the CO gas pressure, from $10^{-10}$ Torr to $0.5$ Torr. As shown in Figure 2, no appreciable change in composition is apparent until $0.01$ Torr, after which a rapid removal of chemisorbed O, from $0.5$ ML to $\\sim 0.05 \\mathrm{ML}$ occurred (red dots in Figure 2c). This was accompanied by an increase in CO coverage, from 0 to $0.5 \\mathrm{ML}$ (black dots in Figure 2c). For comparison the coverage of $\\mathrm{CO}$ on the clean $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ is also shown (cross symbols in Figure 2c). After evacuation of the CO gas phase, the coverage of chemisorbed CO remained unchanged, although a small increase in atomic $\\mathrm{O}$ occurred, likely due background contamination.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-07_236_886_234_1760}\n\\end{center}\n\nFig. 1 STM images acquired at each step of the sample preparation process: (a) $(1 \\times 1)$ Cu(110) surface.

The Co atoms, which have a slightly higher apparent STM contrast than $\\mathrm{Cu}$ atoms produce a varying contrast along the $\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{O}$ chains. (d) Expanded derivate image of area marked by the box. Derivative imaging enhances the contrast variations along the M-O chains. In the ball model insets $\\mathrm{Cu}, \\mathrm{Co}$, and $\\mathrm{O}$ atoms are shown in orange, blue, and red, respectively.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-07_1229_1839_234_1886}\n\nFig. 2 (a) O 1s, and (b) C 1s, regions of the XPS spectrum of the CuCo surface alloy (20\\% Co-80\\% Cu) under various CO pressures. The attenuated peak intensities at higher gas pressure are due to increased scattering of photoelectrons by gas phase molecules. The surface is initially covered with oxygen, which produces the peak at $529.9 \\mathrm{eV}$. The $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}$ peaks from $\\mathrm{CO}_{\\text {ads }}$ appear at $531.9 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $285.7 \\mathrm{eV}$, similar to those of $\\mathrm{CO}_{\\text {ads }}$ on Co (Figure S1). The gas phase CO peaks are shown enclosed by a dashed box, their exact position depanding on the surface work function. The graphs in (c) show the coverage of $\\mathrm{CO}(\\bullet)$ and O ( $\\boldsymbol{\\square})$ vs CO presssure. The CO reacts and removes O from the surface at appreciable rates above $0.01$ Torr. The CO coverage on pure $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ in equilibirum with the $\\mathrm{CO}$ pressure is shown for reference $(\\times)$. The box on the right shows the coverage after evacuation (Vac), and after heating to $400 \\mathrm{~K}$. Coverage of different species as a function of pressure in (c) was determined from the O 1s peak intensities with respect to the $\\mathrm{Cu} 2 \\mathrm{p}$ + Co $2 \\mathrm{p}$ peak intensities measured at the same kinetic energy, and using the wellknown $0.5$ ML coverage of the $(2 \\times 1)$ oxide structure as reference. Since the XPS peaks of CO/CuCo (Figures 2a and b) are similar to those on CO/Co (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information (SI)), we conclude that the majority of the CO molecules are bound to $\\mathrm{Co}$, or to $\\mathrm{Cu}$ atoms modified by binding to Co. DFT calculations and other experimental techniques discussed below show that the former case is correct. Since the Co coverage is $\\sim 0.2 \\mathrm{ML}$, this implies that more than one CO molecule is bound per Co atom on average. This interesting and unexpected result is in line with a 3-decades old result of CO adsorption on Co clusters deposited on $\\mathrm{Cu}(100)$, obtained with AES and thermal desorption spectroscopy. ${ }^{36}$\n\nThe changes in the chemical state of Co due to CO adsorption were followed by the shifts in binding energy (BE) of its $2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ core levels and by the changing intensities of the $\\mathrm{Co}^{0}$ and $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ components, as shown in Figure 3. The intensities of the $\\mathrm{Co}^{0}$ and $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ peaks and their satellites were measured by fitting them according to the procedure suggested in Ref. ${ }^{37}$ (examples shown by the red and blue curves for the UHV spectra). We find that initially about half of the Co appears as $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$, located on the top M-O rows, whilst the other half, corresponding to $\\mathrm{Co}^{\\circ}$, is located in the second layer. This ratio remained unchanged under CO gas up to $0.01$ Torr where it started to decrease (Figure 3b) due to reduction of the $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$. At $0.5$ Torr reduction to the metallic state proceeds rapidly, and only small amounts of $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ remain (Figure 3b). The $\\mathrm{Cu}$ atoms on the other hand are fully reduced at this pressure. ${ }^{38}$ Particularly interesting is the shift in the $\\mathrm{Co}^{0} 2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ $\\mathrm{BE}$ observed in these experiments, where the Co coverage is $0.2 \\mathrm{ML}$ (Figure 3c black dots). At Co coverages above $0.5 \\mathrm{ML}$ (red dots), where Co and CoO form larger islands, no shift was observed. The shift of the Co $2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ peak to a higher BE indicates an increasing donation of electrons from Co to CO, which we ascribe to binding of multiple CO molecules per Co atom, similar to the structure of Co-carbonyl species. This is only possible if Co is in the form of isolated atoms or few atom clusters where the bound CO molecules can fan out to accommodate their steric repulsion. As we show below DFT calculations indicate that the Co atoms in the second layer are pulled out to the top layer by CO chemisorption, where it forms small clusters.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-09_238_1094_239_1223}\n\nFig. 3 (a) Co $2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ XP spectra acquired at RT as a function of increasing CO pressure, from UHV (bottom black spectrum) to $0.5$ Torr (brown). The two spectra at the top were collected after CO evacuation (pink) and after heating the sample to $400 \\mathrm{~K}$ (top, dark yellow). Co $2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ has satellite peaks from $\\mathrm{Co}^{0}$ and $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$, were fitted with the red $\\left(\\mathrm{Co}^{0}\\right)$ and blue $\\left(\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}\\right)$ curves, shown only for the initial spectrum in UHV (bottom). The amount of $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ decreases above $0.01$ Torr (b), while CO coverage increases (c). The Co XPS peaks shift to higher binding energy (black curve in (c)), following the increasing number of CO molecules per Co atom at low Co coverage. No XPS shifts were observed when the Co coverage was $>0.5 \\mathrm{ML}$ (red dots in (c)) due to steric contraints preventing multiple CO binding per Co atom (except possibly at island edge atoms).\n\nIn agreement with XPS, the STM images confirmed the removal of the oxide structure on the surface as the CO pressure increased (Figures S5-S6). After the $(2 \\times 1)$ oxide structure is removed the surface is covered with 2D nanoclusters of irregular shape (Figure S7). Figure 4 shows an atomically resolved image, where the clusters appear as dimer rows at pressures above $0.5$ Torr. The dimers appear as pairs of bright spots along the [110] direction separated by $3.5 \\AA$, substantially larger than the atomic lattice spacing of $2.55 \\AA$. We explain this by assigning the maxima to CO molecules that are adsorbed on the top sites and tilted away from each other due to steric repulsion. On the [001] direction the periodicity is $3 \\AA$, which is less that the atomic periodicity $3.61 \\AA$ in that direction. We attribute this adsorption geometry to the formation of locally dense CO structures with more than one molecule per Co atom, as shown schematically in Figure 4c. From IRRAS (see below) we know that CO adsorbs both on top and on bridge Co sites, so that the observed STM contrast can originate from combinations of 3 CO (2 top sites, 1 bridge site) and 5 CO (4 top sites, 1 bridge site) molecules. According to our model in Figure 4c, CO molecules at the bridge sites have a very low STM contrast, because in mixed top and bridge or hollow CO sites, the STM contrast is dominated by that of the top sites. ${ }^{12,39-40}$ While from STM imaging only it is not possible to prove this at present, both IR spectra and DFT calculations (shown later) indicate that CO molecules occupy both atop and bridge sites simultaneously. In fact, DFT calculations support this model by showing that isolated 2-Co-atom clusters accommodating $5 \\mathrm{CO}$ molecules are energetically favored.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that the surface has a considerable number steps with\n\n(a)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-10_899_1937_249_743}\n\\end{center}\n\nheights of 1 and two atoms. An alternative structure is one where CO adsorbs only on top sites in the terraces (same as in Figure 4c, but with the bridge CO molecules missing), with $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorption on the bridge sites occurring only at step edges. This alternative model, however, is not supported by the DFT calculations, which show that additional CO molecules adsorb on the bridge sites before two CO molecules start occupying a single CO (c)\n\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-10_1564_1662_752_1015}\\\\\n$\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { : cu } & \\\\ \\text { : co } & \\text { site. }\\end{array}$\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-10_1722_1920_740_1103}\n\\end{center}\n\nFig. 4 (a) STM image of the CuCo surface under 3 Torr CO. The maxima are assigned to CO molecules bound to top Co sites forming dimers in short rows along the [100] direction, as indicated in the expanded area below (b). (c) is the surface structure of the suggested model. According to this model, we can estimate $1.75 \\mathrm{CO}$ to be on the Co sites, equivalent to $0.35 \\mathrm{ML}$ nominal coverage. The rest of CO (0.15 ML nominal coverage) should be on the Cu sites, which constitute $80 \\%$ of the surface, hence roughly $0.19$ CO per Cu site.\n\n\\subsection{IRRAS studies}\nIn addition to XPS and STM, we studied the CO adsorption after oxide removal with IRRAS. The high structural sensitivity of the technique makes it ideal to study fine details of the adsorption of CO, thus providing a complementary identification of the adsorption sites. As suggested by Toomes and King, ${ }^{41} \\mathrm{CO}$ adsorbed on top metallic sites has C-O stretching frequencies in the 2000-2130 $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range, whereas on bridge sites the frequency range is 1860$2000 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. On clean Cu surfaces, at pressures below 1 Torr, CO adsorbs only on top sites with frequencies in the $2070-2106 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ range. $^{42}$\n\nWeakening of the CO-metal bond decreases back bonding donation to the antibonding $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals thus strengthening the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond and shifting the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ stretch frequency to higher values. The CO-metal bonding strength depends also on the type of metal, e.g., Cu, Co, site coordination (top, bridge, hollow), and is expected to decrease also by repulsion between CO molecules adsorbed on a single Co site. Figure 5 shows IRRAS data of the $0.2 \\mathrm{ML}$ of CuCo surface in the presence of $\\mathrm{CO}$ at various pressures. No adsorbed $\\mathrm{CO}$ peak is visible at pressures below $10^{-2}$ Torr (red curve), where the surface is still oxidized (0.5 ML of O). At $0.1$ Torr CO, when most of the oxide is reduced to metal, a CO peak is observed at a frequency corresponding to bridge sites at $1983 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. The peak shifts to higher frequencies at $0.5$ Torr (peaks 4', 3', 2' and 1'), between 2000 $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to $2100 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. Peak 1' matches the frequency for top $\\mathrm{Cu}$ sites, 2' to that of multiple molecules per Co atom in small clusters or at edges, and $3^{\\prime}$ to top Co sites. ${ }^{43}$ The shifts in CO stretch frequencies due to multiple CO binding in Co-carbonyl molecules were reported in Ref. ${ }^{44,45}$ Carbonyl-like CO adsorption was also observed in surface science studies ${ }^{46}$, which show that two CO molecules can adsorb to isolated Rh atoms and or on few atom clusters, with a blue shift in the CO symmetric stretch frequency compared to CO adsorbed on larger Rh islands.\n\nThe high frequency peaks disappear upon evacuation of the gas phase, leaving only the 5' peak from the bridge sites (cyan curve). A new peak (6'), observed after evacuation could be due to the $\\mathrm{CO}$ bound to unreduced $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ residuals. ${ }^{47}$ Although $\\mathrm{CO}$ might not be stable at $\\mathrm{RT}$ on $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ sites on bulk Co oxides, it may be different here where the $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ may be affected by the $\\mathrm{Cu}$ substrate, as seen previously for $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorption on $\\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$being stronger when it is linked to Ti. ${ }^{48}$ This 6' feature is likely to be there in the presence of $\\mathrm{CO}$ as well, but coincides with the gas phase features.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-12_234_1110_237_890}\n\\end{center}\n\nFig. 5 IRRAS spectra of CO on the CuCo surface in the presence of CO gas at different pressures. Gas phase peaks are visible above $0.01$ Torr, by the broad bands between $2100-2200 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. Adsorbed species are indicated with the prime symbol ('), and are explained in the main text.\n\nThe above assignments are supported by the additional spectra acquired from CO on pure $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$, on $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)-(2 \\times 1) \\mathrm{O}$ and on CuCo at cryogenic temperatures, shown in the SI (Figures S3 and S4). Similarly, Figure S5 shows the spectra of CO adsorbed on $10 \\mathrm{ML}$ of Co.\n\nAlthough the shifts in Co $2 p$ spectra to higher binding energies and the shifts to higher wavenumbers of the CO stretching frequencies as the CO pressure increases appear at first contradictory, this is not the case. The IR blue shift suggests less back donation to a single CO, with the XPS shift is due to more electron donation from Co to multiple CO molecules. Finally, we would like to remark on the 1' peak in Figure 5 (CuCo surface at $0.5$ Torr) being significantly less intense than the $1^{\\prime}$ peak in Figure S3 in SI (bare Cu(110) surface at $0.5$ Torr). This might potentially be due to a similar effect observed on the deposition of Fe on Cu surfaces, i.e., CO attached to Cu atoms that are intermixed with Fe atoms with a specific surface lattice structure. ${ }^{49}$ However, in line with our APXPS spectra and the DFT calculations shown below, we think that this is simply a steric effect of $\\mathrm{CO}$ covering the Co sites and preventing CO from attaching to the neighboring Cu sites. In other words, the local CO coverage on the Cu sites is significantly less than local CO coverage on the Co sites.\n\n\\subsection{DFT calculations}\nTo determine the equilibrium structure of the CO/CuCo system formed on Cu(110) by deposition of $0.2 \\mathrm{ML}$ of Co, we calculated the surface Gibbs free energy $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}(\\theta, \\chi)$ at fixed T-p conditions (1 Torr $\\mathrm{CO}$ at RT, see SI). ${ }^{50}$ Figure 6 shows a $3 \\mathrm{D}$ plot of $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ (in color) as a function of $\\mathrm{CO}$ coverage $(\\theta)$, and fraction of Co atoms in the top layer $(\\chi)$. At zero CO coverage the calculations predict that Co atoms are preferentially located in the second layer in the $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ matrix (point 1 in the diagram, top structure 1). This agrees with the surface segregation trends found in the literature, ${ }^{51-53}$ where adsorption of CO causes Co atoms to segregate to the top layer where it bounds to CO (point 2 in the diagram, top structure 2). As the CO coverage reached approx. $0.75$ ML (red area in the diagram), all Co atoms are in the top layer bound to CO molecules. The most energetically stable structure, point 4 in the diagram, has an average occupancy of $2.5$ CO molecules per Co atom, as shown as the structure 4 in the top schematic.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-13_1126_1931_367_1389}\n\\end{center}\n\nFig. 6 Gibbs free energy $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ in the parameter space of $\\chi$ (Co surface population, Y-axis) and $\\theta$ (CO coverage, X-axis), in equilibrium with 1 Torr of CO at RT. The percentage of Co atoms is fixed at $20 \\%$ in the surface alloy formed on the surface of $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$, with the Co atoms occupying sites in the first or second layer. The color scale in the right hand side indicates the values of $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ quantifying the stability of the different CO/CuCo phases. Selected atomic structures at points 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown at the top,. Cu atoms are shown in ocher color and the Co atoms in pink. Structure 4 is the most stable configuration.\n\nWe next address the impact of temperature and CO pressure. In Figure 7, we display the T-p phase diagrams for a $\\operatorname{CuCo}(110)$ surface in equilibrium with a surrounding $\\mathrm{CO}$ gas phase environment. The most stable CuCo phase at high temperatures and low CO pressures (Figure 7 ; bottom right) corresponds to the bare CuCo substrate, with the Co atoms located in the second layer. Figure 7 also shows the relevant phases in the whole range of experimentally accessible pressure conditions, $10^{-13}$ to $10^{3}$ Torr, indicating the stability of CO/CuCo phases with $0.50$ and $0.75$ ML CO coverage (Figure 7; structures A and B, respectively). Importantly, in this T-p range the CO molecules adsorb only on the Co sites, in agreement with our recent study of adsorption of $\\mathrm{CO}$ on pure $\\mathrm{Cu}(111)$, where $\\mathrm{CO}$ was found to adsorb only at step edges. ${ }^{12}$\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-14_709_1405_370_1370}\n\\end{center}\n\nFig. 7 T-p plot showing the CO/CuCo phase diagram in a wide range of T-p conditions.

At low Co coverage ( 0.2 ML) Co atoms substitute Cu atoms in the surface and subsurface forming small clusters of one or few Co atoms. Using XPS and IRRAS spectroscopies, together with DFT calculations, we determined the equilibrium structures formed by adsorption of CO on the bimetallic CuCo surface alloy. In the absence of CO, the Co atoms occupy preferentially second layer sites. In the presence of CO at pressures above $0.1$ Torr CO pulls Co to the top surface layer and binds to it forming structures where multiple CO molecules attach to one Co atom. The multiple binding of CO molecules gives rise to shifts in the binding energy of the Co $2 p$ core level peaks due to increased donation of electrons to CO, a process akin to the formation of carbonyls. This means that the CuCo surface might have different catalytic properties than that of Cu or Co because such multiple CO adsorption on a single Co site weakens the M-CO bond and can thereby reduce the C-O bond scission probability. In addition to new fundamental information on the chemisorption of CO on alloy surfaces, this study might help explain the higher selectivity towards oxygenated products when CuCo is used instead of Co during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Future design of bimetallic catalysts should take the peculiar behavior of the alloy constituents into account, and it is clear that further work on other bimetallic systems is necessary with the newly developed surface science techniques applicable in the presence of gases.\n\n\\section{SUPPORTING INFORMATION}\nReference APXPS and IRRAS spectra, HPSTM images at lower pressures, explanation of Gibbs free energy of the system, more details of our DFT calculations.\n\n\\section{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}\nThis work was supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DEAC02-05CH11231, through the Structure and Dynamics of Materials Interfaces (FWP KC31SM).

Similar to deposition rate measurements with QCM, the Co surface layer underneath the oxygen top layer is calculated to have $21 \\%$ Co and $79 \\% \\mathrm{Cu}$ using the XPS $\\mathrm{Cu} 2 \\mathrm{p}$ and Co $2 \\mathrm{p}$ peak intensities (85:15) and the Strohmeier equation [S1]. The 85:15 ratio remained unchanged throughout the experiments indicating Co neither desorbs via forming a carbonyl at pressures up to $0.5$ Torr of CO nor it diffuses into the bulk.\n\n\\section{CO Adsorption - Reference $O$ 1s and C 1s Spectra}\nIn this section, we compare the core level $\\mathrm{O}$ 1s and $\\mathrm{C}$ 1s spectra of CO adsorption on three surface: 1- our alloy CuCo surface, 2- a bare $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ surface, and 3- a 10 ML Co thin film. The latter two are used as references for the pure $\\mathrm{Cu}$ and $\\mathrm{Co}$ metals.\n\nFigure S1 shows an example of XPS spectra collected during CO adsorption on the surface, as well as reference measurements of $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorption on $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ and on a thin Co film. On $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$, peaks arising from $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorption are at around $531.1 \\mathrm{eV}$, and $286.1 \\mathrm{eV}$ with a strong satellite at $288.4 \\mathrm{eV}$ [27]. This strong satellite feature in the C 1s region is due to weak chemisorption of CO on Cu [S2]. On the $10 \\mathrm{ML}$ Co film, CO peaks appear at $531.7$ and $285.7 \\mathrm{eV}$ without any satellite features. On the CuCo surface, the CO peaks appear at $531.9 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $285.7$ $\\mathrm{eV}$, indicating that $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{CuCo}$ has the same peak position as $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{Co}$ in the $\\mathrm{O} 1 \\mathrm{~s}$ region and peak position somewhere between CO/Co and $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{Cu}$ in the $\\mathrm{C} 1$ s region. However, in the $\\mathrm{C} 1$ s region no satellite peak was observed for CO adsorbed on CuCo, which is an indicative of strong chemisorption (weaker than on pure Co but stronger than on pure $\\mathrm{Cu}$ ) [S2]. Both observations suggest that there are only few $\\mathrm{CO}$ molecules are adsorbed on bare $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$, which occupies $79 \\%$ of the surface.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-21_239_748_236_1212}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure S1 O 1s (left) and C 1s (right) regions of the XPS spectrum for CO adsorption on Cu(110) (black curve), on a Co 10 ML film (red curve), and on the CuCo alloy sample (blue curve). The black curve was acquired at $0.2$ Torr, whereas the other two curves were acquired at $0.1$ Torr CO. The boxed region indicate the gas phase $\\mathrm{CO}(\\mathrm{g})$ species, appearing at different energies due to different work function of the sample surface. The peak positions and line shapes of adsorbed CO(ad) species on the CuCo system is more similar to those on Co thin films than those on $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$.\n\n\\section{CO Adsorption as a function of pressure}\nFigure S2 shows the $\\mathrm{O}$ 1s and $\\mathrm{C}$ 1s regions of the XPS spectra under various CO pressures. The peak positions and full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the $\\mathrm{O} 1 \\mathrm{~s}$ and $\\mathrm{C} 1 \\mathrm{~s}$ regions of $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorbed on CuCo remained unchanged in the pressure range of $1 \\times 10^{-6}$ to $0.5$ Torr of CO (Figure S2).\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-21_1596_2296_281_1931}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure S2 O 1s (left) and C 1s (right) regions of the XPS spectrum of the CuCo surface under various CO pressures. The surface is initially covered with atomic oxygen which produces the XPS peak at around $529.9 \\mathrm{eV}$. The CO adsorption peaks appear at approximately $531.9 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $285.7 \\mathrm{eV}$, similar to those of CO adsorbed on a 10 ML Co thin film. The gas phase CO peak energies are above $537 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $291 \\mathrm{eV}$ (exact position depands on the work function), and they are shown inside dashed rectangular boxes. Once CO is removed from the gas phase and after the sample is heated up to $400 \\mathrm{~K}$, all the CO is removed from the surface. Small amounts of hydrocarbons desorbing from the chamber walls in the presence of CO in the Torr range, slowly contaminate the sample surface once CO is evacuated (peaks around $284.4 \\mathrm{eV}$ start to appear).The small peak around $283.2 \\mathrm{eV}$ is due to carbon in carbide-like species formed by contamination and beam damage effects. We minimized the increase of this peak by changing the measurement spot for each spectrum.\n\n\\section{CO-induced Shifts in Co $2 p$}\nAs explained in the main text, $\\mathrm{Co}^{0} 2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ peak position from the CuCo alloy surface shifts to higher binding energies as the CO pressure is increased (Figure 3), when the Co surface population is around $20 \\%$. The same is true for the $\\mathrm{Co}^{0} 2 \\mathrm{p}_{1 / 2}$, $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+} 2 \\mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$, and the $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+} 2 \\mathrm{p}_{1 / 2}$ peak positions.\n\n\\section{S2 - IRRAS}\nBecause CO peak position depends on the adsorption site (e.g., Cu or Co, top-site or bridgesite, etc.), presence of atomic oxygen on the surface and CO coverage, we acquired various reference spectra at $90 \\mathrm{~K}$ following a few Langmuir exposures and at RT under ambient CO pressure. The next three spectra are used as reference to interpret the IRRAS results shown in Figure 5 of the main text.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-23_240_1289_236_1147}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure S3 IRRAS spectra of $\\mathrm{CO}$ at RT on: (a) bare $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$, and (b) oxygen-covered $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)-(2 \\times 1)$-O surfaces. In (a): (i) in UHV, (ii) in the presence of $0.02$ Torr of CO, (iii) in the presence of $0.5$ Torr of CO, (iv) after evacuation of CO. Top: reference spectrum after dosing $0.2 \\mathrm{~L}$ of CO with the sample at $90 \\mathrm{~K}$. In (b): (i) in UHV, (ii) in the presence of $0.01$ Torr of CO, (iii) in the presence of $0.1$ Torr of CO, (iv) in the presence of $0.5$ Torr of CO, (v) after evacuation of CO. Top: ref. spectrum after dosing $0.2 \\mathrm{~L}$ of CO with the sample at $90 \\mathrm{~K}$. The peaks from adsorbed CO are marked with primed numbers: $1^{\\prime}$ at $2084-2086 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ due to $\\mathrm{CO}$ on $\\mathrm{Cu}$ with coordination number (CN) $=7 ; 2^{\\prime}$ at $2099 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ from $\\mathrm{CO}$ on $\\mathrm{Cu}$ with $\\mathrm{CN}=6$; and $3^{\\prime}$ at $2104 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (in b-ref.) from $\\mathrm{CO}$ on intact $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)-(2 \\times 1)-\\mathrm{O}$. The absence of this feature in other spectra in (b) is due to the negligible amount of adsorbed CO, due to its low adsorption energy on the oxygen-covered surface. In this surface CO adsorbs only on vacant $\\mathrm{Cu}$ sites created by the $\\mathrm{CO}+1 / 2 \\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reaction. The scale bar is the same for (a) and (b).

We have reported that this surface breaks up into clusters a few nanometer long oriented along the [1-10] direction and separated by typically two atomic distances, i.e., $0.72 \\mathrm{~nm}$ in the [100] direction with $(1 \\times 2)$ periodicity. This restructuring of the $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ surface in the presence of $\\mathrm{CO}$ is different than that of the model $\\operatorname{CuCo}(110)$ surface used in the present work (Figure 4).\n\n\\section{CuCo before Reduction}\nAs shown in our previous work, $\\mathrm{p}(2 \\times 1)-\\mathrm{O}$ reconstruction on $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ remains for long times at CO pressures below $0.02$ Torr at $298 \\mathrm{~K}$ [32] due to high binding energy of atomic oxygen in the added rows (around $2 \\mathrm{eV}$ ) [S3]. This is also partially the case for the CuCo surface. Examples are shown in the low and high magnification HPSTM images in Figure S6a and b, respectively. It is not clear from these images if the clusters on the surface are pure Co (i.e., phase separation), or they are the initial nano-islands formed during the sample preparation process. However, there is a considerable amount of adsorbed CO $(0.13 \\mathrm{ML})$ already at $0.01$ Torr on this surface compared to $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)-\\mathrm{p}(2 \\times 1)-\\mathrm{O}$ which was below $0.01 \\mathrm{ML}$ (coverages estimated from APXPS measurements) [14, 32]. CO probably adsorbs on Co rich parts and breaks the (2\u00d71) periodicity. The surface does not exhibit this periodicity in Figure S6b are Co, although CO may have not entirely removed the initial oxygen attached to it. In summary, the surface is a mixture of ordered $\\mathrm{O}$ on $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ and disordered $\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}$ on $\\mathrm{Co}$ in this pressure range.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-26_1794_2445_297_1308}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure S6 STM image at $0.01$ Torr of CO. (2x1)-O structure is mostly intact at pressures below $0.1$ Tor of CO, although in some other areas it starts to disappear and form irregular clusters. We attribute these to Co-rich sites, on which CO can adsorb.\n\n\\section{CuCo after Reduction}\nAt $0.1$ Torr and above, the $p(2 \\times 1)-\\mathrm{O}$ structure is removed completely by reaction with $\\mathrm{CO}(\\mathrm{O}+$ $\\mathrm{CO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) After this up to $0.5 \\mathrm{ML}$ of $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorbs on the CuCo surface. Between $0.5$ and 3 Torr of CO, the surface is broken up into linear clusters oriented along the [001] direction\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-27_865_2128_234_866}\n\\end{center}\n\nC\n\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-27_2132_2324_434_819}\\\\\n(Figure S7a).\n\nIn addition to the discussion in the main text, figures S7b and S7c we found that atomic resolution could be only observed on the linear structures visible in Figure S7b. Streaky traces on the other parts of the surface is due to high adsorbate mobility, likely due to CO weakly adsorbed on Cu sites. The weakening of the adsorption is due to steric repulsion between $\\mathrm{CO}$ molecules, which also blocks $\\mathrm{CO}$ adsorption at $\\mathrm{Cu}$ sites next to the Co atoms very unlikely. However $\\mathrm{CO}$ can adsorb on $\\mathrm{Cu}$ sites far away from Co sites, but unlike on the bare $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ surface [14], no $(1 \\times 2)$ reconstruction is observed in the alloy surface.\n\nFigure S7 After the O-layer is removed by reaction with CO at a pressure of $0.5$ Torr and higher, CO adsorbs on the $\\mathrm{CuCo}(110)$ surface and forms a peculiar adlayer structure in certain areas which are probably Co-rich. $\\mathrm{Cu}$ and Co cannot be distinguished from their STM contrast in these images. No $(1 \\times 2)$ structure related to $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ can be observed.\n\n\\section{S4- DFT}\n\\section{Gibbs Free Energy Formalism}\nWe use surface Gibbs free energies - a formalism extensively employed to study materials under working conditions [S4-S5] - to compare the stability of different CO/CuCo phases, with the following formulation: the Gibbs free energy $\\Delta G(\\theta, \\chi)$ of the $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{CuCo}$ system depends on the CO coverage, $\\theta$, defined as the number of CO molecules per area unit, and the Co surface percent population, $\\chi$, defined as the number of Co atoms at the surface with respect to the total number of Co atoms in the cell. We computed surface Gibbs free energies $\\Delta G(\\theta, \\chi)$ according to Eq. 1\n\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{G}(\\theta, \\chi)=\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CO}-\\mathrm{CuCo}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Cu}} \\mathrm{E}^{\\mathrm{Bulk}}{ }_{\\mathrm{Cu}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} \\mathrm{E}^{\\mathrm{Bulk}}{ }_{\\mathrm{Co}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CO}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{ads}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{b}} \\mathrm{TLn}\\left(\\mathrm{p} / p^{0}\\right)\\right) / \\mathrm{A}$ where $E_{C O-C u C o}, E^{B u l k}{ }_{C u}$ and $E^{\\text {Bulk }}{ }_{C u}$ are respectively the total energy of the alloy-for a given $\\chi$ solute distribution-and the total energy of bulk $\\mathrm{Cu}$ and $\\mathrm{Co} . E_{C O}$, on the other hand is the total energy of gas CO. $N_{C u}, N_{C o}$ and $N_{C O}$ are the number of $\\mathrm{Cu}$ and $\\mathrm{Co}$ atoms in the unit cell, and the number of $\\mathrm{CO}$ molecules in the $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{CuCo}$ system. $T$ is the temperature and $p$ is the $\\mathrm{CO}$ pressure with respect to the standard pressure $p^{0}$ equal to 1 atm. $k_{b}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $A$ is the area of the unit cell $\\left(73.72 \\AA^{2}\\right)$. We referred the $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ values with respect to the surface energy value for the most stable solute arrangement $\\left(93 \\mathrm{meV} / \\AA^{2}\\right) . \\Delta S_{a d s}$ is the entropy change for the adsorption defined as in\n\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{ads}}=\\left(\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{CO}-\\mathrm{CuCo}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Cu}} \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{Cu}}^{\\mathrm{Bulk}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{Co}}^{\\mathrm{Bulk}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{CO}}^{0}\\right)$\n\nwe assume $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{CO}-\\mathrm{CuCo}} \\sim \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{S}^{\\mathrm{Ads}}{ }_{\\mathrm{CO}+} \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{CuCo}}$ and neglect the formation entropy of the alloy in comparison to the gas adsorbate so that $\\Delta S_{a d s}$ becomes\n\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{ads}}=\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\left(\\mathrm{S}^{\\mathrm{Ads}} \\mathrm{co}^{0} \\mathrm{~S}_{\\mathrm{CO}}^{0}\\right)$.\n\nIn Eq. $3 S_{C O}^{0}$ is the standard entropy of gas $\\mathrm{CO}(195 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{molK}$ at $273 \\mathrm{~K}$ in agreement with NIST [S6]) and $S^{A d s}$ co is the entropy of adsorbed CO. We used the empirical relationship developed by Campbell [S7] to describe the entropy of adsorbed adsorbates: $\\mathrm{S}^{\\mathrm{Ads}} \\mathrm{CO}^{\\sim 0.7} \\mathrm{~S}^{0} \\mathrm{CO}$.\n\nIn order to construct $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ maps (Figure 6) we studied CO-CuCo structures with increasing Co surface population $\\chi$, from zero for the case in which all Co is located in the subsurface to $100 \\%$ when both Co atoms in the unit cell populate the Cu matrix surface. At each $\\chi$ value we addressed the adsorption of CO for a range of increasing coverage, from zero to 1ML. For each coverage, we found the most stable adsorption arrangement for $\\mathrm{CO}$ in the CuCo cell, considering all possible $\\mathrm{Cu}$ and $\\mathrm{Co}$ adsorption sites. That gave a grid of (7x3) $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ values. A continues $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ map was created by interpolating the Gibbs free energy values in the grid. We report average binding energies $E_{b}$ in Table $\\mathrm{S} 2$ for all structures in the $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ grid and the atomistic structures of the CO-CuCo phases are displayed in Figure $\\mathrm{S} 8 . E_{b}$ were all computed with respect to the most stable CuCo arrangement in the absence of $\\mathrm{CO}$ as in\n\n$\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CO}-\\mathrm{CuCo}}-\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CuCo}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\right) / \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{CO}}$\n\nTable S2. Calculated CO average binding energies $E_{b}$ in eV for three different Co surface populations $\\chi-0 \\%$ with Co atoms located in the subsurface of the $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ matrix and $100 \\%$ with Co located in the surface of the $\\mathrm{Cu}(110)$ matrix, and $50 \\%$ with Co located on the surface and subsurface - and increasing CO coverage in ML.

The energy to separate these dimers from its most stable arrangement until $\\mathrm{d}_{\\mathrm{Co}-\\mathrm{Co}}=5.11 \\AA$ is $119 \\mathrm{meV} / \\mathrm{Co}$. We further computed segregation energies, $E_{S e g}$, defined per Co atoms as in\n\n$\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{Seg}}=\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CuCo}}(\\chi=100 \\%)-\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CuCo}}(\\chi=0 \\%)\\right) / \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}}$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CuCo}}(\\chi)$ is the total energy of the CuCo substrate for a give Co surface population. $E_{S e g}$ is the energy needed to move the metal impurity from the bulk of the host material to the surface: the lower is $E_{S e g}$ the stronger would be the tendency for the Co impurity to segregate to the surface. $E_{\\text {Seg }}$ in the absence of $\\mathrm{CO}$ was $348 \\mathrm{meV}$, being this value positive and in qualitative agreement with the literature [42, S8]. This means that in the absence of CO segregation of Co is thermodynamically unfavorable and will not happen under normal conditions. This also means that in the absence of CO the surface will mostly contain $\\mathrm{Cu}$ while the Co atoms will be located in the subsurface. However, this does not necessarily may be observed experimentally because at RT might the Co adatoms diffuse too slowly into the subsurface. Also surface oxygen reduces the surface energy. $E_{S e g}$ was found to be $-234 \\mathrm{meV}$ at 1 ML CO coverage. The fact that this value is negative indicates that in the presence of CO Co prefers to segregate and hence the surface would mostly contain the Co component of the alloy. Similar effect has been found for other adsorbates and substrates [S9].\n\nWe now address the energetics of CO adsorption in the CuCo substrate for increasing CO coverage. The calculated CO average binding energy $E_{b}$ for different Co surface populations are reported in Table S2. Our results indicate that CO molecules adsorb on the different Cu top sites of the surface when Co populates the subsurface of the Cu matrix. A moderate binding energy increase with coverage was found, suggesting weak CO-CO repulsion. Differently, CO molecules bond to the Co top sites with a more pronounced CO-CO repulsion (See Figure S8 for more detail on the structures). These observations are consistent with the stronger affinity of CO to Co compared to $\\mathrm{Cu}$.\n\nIn order to bring more insight into the distribution of CO molecules in the CuCo substrate, we display in Figure S9 (Right Panel) a plot of the number of CO molecules adsorbed per Co atom for increasing CO coverage. The results indicate that Co sites are able to accommodate several CO molecules, with a maximum of $2.5 \\mathrm{CO}$ molecules/Co site for CO coverage of 0.6-0.8ML.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-31_1824_2350_248_1454}Figure S9 (Left panel) Gibbs free energies $\\Delta G$ as a function of the chemical potential of CO.

The blue dashed lines highlights the working ambient-pressure conditions. See Figure S8 for the structure labels. (Right panel) Number of CO molecules per Co atom, for increasing CO coverage.\n\nWe finally address the structure of $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{CuCo}$ in the presence of $\\mathrm{CO}$ at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Figure S9 (Left Panel) shows a free surface energy plot $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ $(\\Delta \\mu)$ as a function of the CO chemical potential of $\\Delta \\mu$,\n\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{G}(\\Delta \\mu)=\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{CO}-\\mathrm{CuCo}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Cu}} \\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{Cu}}^{\\mathrm{Bulk}}-\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{Co}} \\mathrm{E}^{\\mathrm{Bulk}}{ }_{\\mathrm{Co}}-\\Delta \\mu\\right) / \\mathrm{A}$\n\nFigure S9 include all CO/CuCo structures at increasing CO coverage at different Co surface populations. This is contrast to Figure 7 in which only the most stable CO-CuCo phases are visible. For low CO chemical potential, the most stable phase is the bare CuCo substrate with Co atoms populating the subsurface. The adsorption of CO only starts once $\\Delta \\mu$ reaches the critical value of $1.5 \\mathrm{eV}$. At moderate and high $\\Delta \\mu$ values, CO molecules adsorb on the Co sites leading to $0.5 \\mathrm{ML}$ and $0.75 \\mathrm{ML}$. Our results indicate that $\\mathrm{CO} / \\mathrm{CuCo}$ phases with $0.75 \\mathrm{ML} \\mathrm{CO}$ coverage are present in the phase diagram at ambient conditions, containing of five $\\mathrm{CO}$ molecules bonded to the Co sites and a single CO molecule bonded to Cu. The average C-O distance in the 5CO-Co moiety is $1.18 \\AA$ (molecules 1-5 in Figure S10 Top panel), being this distance $1.14 \\AA$ for the CO molecule bonded to Cu (molecule 6 in Figure S10 Top panel). Both distances are slightly larger than for the case of gas $\\mathrm{CO}(1.13 \\AA)$. The average C-Co distance is $1.79 \\AA$ for the top CO molecules in the 5CO-Co moiety (molecules 1, 2, 3 and 5 in Figure S10 Top panel), being $1.93$ A for the bridge CO (molecule 4 in Figure S10 Top panel). The C-Co distance for the CO bonded to $\\mathrm{Cu}$ is $1.86 \\AA$ (molecule 6 in Figure S10 Top panel). We found in the experiments that the adsorption of CO pulls the Co atoms away from the surface. The average vertical distance of the Co atoms with respect to the outermost $\\operatorname{CuCo}(110)$ plane is $0.51 \\AA$.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_07b4d66e23971ccb85c0g-32_2072_2460_248_1348}\n\nFigure S10 Top and side views of the most stable CO/CuCo phase at working conditions (structure 4 on Figure 6 and $\\mathrm{R}$ on Figure S8).

Binding energies are reported in Table S4 and Gibbs free energy diagrams with respect to the chemical potential of $\\mathrm{CO}$ are displayed in Figure S11. The results indicate the well-known overbidding of PW91 in comparison to RPBE, which in general reports more positive binding energies [S12]. The vdW-corrected binding energies lay in between the PW91 and RPBE values. The phase diagrams for RPBE and vdW-DF2 in general are shifted towards more positive CO chemical potentials, and the crossing points between different CO-CuCo phases is functional dependent, as these depend on the binding energies. Still, under working conditions, structure 4 remains the most stable CO-CuCo phase. Table S4.
