The kinetics of vibrational relaxation exhibits a biexponential decay including an ultrafast initial relaxation and complete recovery of the ground vibrational state. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and time-dependent perturbation theory reveal the former to be due to vibrational population exchange between CO stretching modes and the latter to be a combination of intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR) and electron-hole pair (EHP) induced energy transfer into the gold substrate. EHP-induced energy transfer from the $\\mathrm{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ adsorbate into the gold surface occurs at the same timescale as IVR of $\\mathrm{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in aprotic solvents. Therefore, it is expected to be particularly relevant to understanding the reduced catalytic activity of the homogeneous catalyst when anchored on a metal surface.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section*{TOC GRAPHIC }\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_e69f3d7ce6c4ff487115g-03_1606_2086_858_1343}\n\\end{center}\n\nUnderstanding vibrational relaxation mechanisms of molecular catalysts on solid surfaces is important for optimizing the efficiency of heterogenized systems for a variety of applications including proton reduction, ${ }^{1}$ olefin metathesis, ${ }^{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction, ${ }^{1,}{ }^{3-11}$ and water oxidation. ${ }^{12-16}$ Three pathways including intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR), intermolecular relaxation, and energy transfer to the solid surface, either via phonon or via electron-hole pair (EHP) coupling may contribute to the vibrational relaxation dynamics of adsorbed catalysts. ${ }^{17-20}$ In comparison with homogeneous catalysts, molecule-substrate interactions may significantly affect vibrational energy transfer pathways, reactivity, and the stability of intermediates. A detailed understanding of the effect of the surface on catalytic activity is urgently needed to understand the functionality of heterogenized vs. homogeneous catalysts. 2, 7, 12, 15-16, 21-24\n\nRhenium bipyridyl tricarbonyl complexes have been reported to be electro- and photocatalysts for $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction in both homogenous and heterogeneous systems. ${ }^{25-30}$ In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to develop heterogeneous catalysts by immobilizing these catalysts on various solid surfaces, aiming for the potential benefits of reduced catalyst loading, convenient separation, and simplicity of scale-up in reactors. $1,4-5,8-10,31$ Due to its inherent surfacesensitivity, time-resolved vibrational sum frequency generation (TR-SFG) spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be an ideal tool to investigate vibrational dynamics of various interfaces. ${ }^{32-37}$ TR-SFG probes have been employed to study the vibrational dynamics of rhenium catalysts tethered to gold surfaces through an alkane thiol spacer. ${ }^{38}$ The negligible substrate effect was attributed to the spacer that hindered energy transfer from the catalyst to the gold surface. ${ }^{38}$ TRSFG studies of these catalysts adsorbed on $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ single crystals revealed that the relaxation time is dependent on the crystallographic facets. ${ }^{39-40}$ 2D-SFG studies were reported to investigate couplings between $\\mathrm{CO}$ modes of rhenium catalyst and image dipoles of gold surface ${ }^{41}$ and structural heterogeneity of the catalyst monolayer on $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ thin film surface. ${ }^{42}$ A 2D-IR study on silica on a related compound showed a significant decrease in the relaxation times relative to the equivalent in solution. ${ }^{6}$ In addition, surface sensitive 2D-IR techniques ${ }^{43}$ have been also used to study structural dynamics, ${ }^{6,44}$ molecular aggregation, ${ }^{45-46}$ and intermolecular energy transfer ${ }^{47}$ for rhenium catalysts covalently adsorbed onto solids. The results of these studies are summarized in Section 5 and Table S5 in the SI. ${ }^{6,38-41,44,48-49}$\n\nHerein, we have investigated the vibrational relaxation mechanism of $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(4,4^{\\prime}\\right.$-dicyano-2,2'bipyridine $)(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}\\left(\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}\\right)$ in various environments by time-resolved vibrational spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. IR pump-SFG probe was employed to investigate the vibrational relaxation dynamics of the $\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{O}$ stretches of the catalyst molecules bound to a gold surface. For comparison, IR pump-IR probe was employed to explore solvent effects on the relaxation rates. By directly calculating the relaxation rates due to EHP using dispersioninclusive density functional theory (DFT), ${ }^{19-20}$ we find that direct adsorption on a gold surface induces vibrational relaxation of the same time scale as IVR. The energy dissipation occurs through a stretching of a CO not covalently attached to the surface, coexisting with IVR from the carbonyl modes, as confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD). To our knowledge, our study represents the first calculation of EHP-induced vibrational relaxation for a molecular catalyst. The reported calculations showcase that EHP-induced vibrational energy cooling can occur at time scales that are relevant to the catalytic function of the adsorbate molecule and may therefore open avenues to control catalytic activity.\n\nFigure 1 shows an IR absorption spectrum of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in MeCN. The spectrum is dominated by three $\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{O}$ stretching modes at 2026, 1926, and $1909 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, the in-phase symmetric stretch (A'(1)), antisymmetric stretch (A\"), and out-of-phase symmetric stretch (A'(2)), respectively. ${ }^{7}$ Similar spectra are observed for the catalyst in acetone and DMF, also shown in Figure 1. For $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ adsorbed on gold, the SFG spectrum is dominated by one peak around $2025 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and one broad band between 1850 and $1950 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Fig. 1). ${ }^{7}$ The opposite spectral shapes between the high- and low-frequency modes, which result from the interference with the nonresonant gold signal, are in accord with the heterodyne-SFG measurements for the rhenium catalyst on gold and $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}{ }^{41-42,50}$ The binding structure of the catalyst is similar to that in our previous work. ${ }^{7}$\n\nFigure 1 (panels $b$ and c) show the resulting optimized geometry of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$, as obtained using DFT with the PBE+vdW surf functional. ${ }^{51-52}$ We find that $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ binds to the $\\mathrm{Au}$ surface with an adsorption energy of $1.56 \\mathrm{eV}$. The cyano group $\\mathrm{N}$ and axial carbonyl $\\mathrm{O}$ are $2.95$ $\\AA$ and $2.69 \\AA$ from the surface, respectively. The resulting three-carbonyl stretching modes are shown in Figure 2. The increased amplitude of the CO stretching displacement relative to those parallel to the bipyridine ring in mode $A^{\\prime}(2)$ has interesting consequences for vibrational relaxation rates (vide infra). The normal mode vectors are not significantly perturbed by the presence of the surface as shown in Table S2.\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_e69f3d7ce6c4ff487115g-06_1889_2477_304_1914}Figure 1.

At early delay times, the TR-SFG spectra consist of instantaneous ground state bleach and stimulated emission (GSB/SE) of the A'(1) mode at 2028 $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and a corresponding excited state absorption (ESA) at $\\sim 2010 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Table S1). At longer delay times, both the recovery of the GSB/SE and the decay of the ESA were observed on similar time scales. The spectra at the lower frequency region are not well resolved due to the overlap between the $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}(2)$ modes. Spectral fitting results show the frequencies of GSB/SE for $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $A^{\\prime}(2)$ are around $1940 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, while those of ESA for these two modes are around $1895 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Table S1). The GSB/SE and ESA for the high-frequency and low-frequency modes have opposite signs due to the phase difference as mentioned above. The recovery of the GSB/SE and the decay of the ESA at low-frequency region show similar time scales as those at the high-frequency region, indicating relaxation of the catalyst molecules back to the ground vibrational state.\n\nDue to interference between the resonant and nonresonant signals, the present TR-SFG data show complicated spectral shape. ${ }^{41-42}$ The explicit expression of the TR-SFG spectra is given in Eq. S7. Based on this expression, the change of SFG intensity is found to be linearly dependent on the population change of the vibrational states, which simplifies the analysis (Eq. S10). Figure 3b shows the kinetics of the GSB/SE and ESA for the A'(1) mode as well as GSB/SE for lowfrequency modes, well described by an instantaneous rise and biexponential decay. The biexponential decay kinetics for the A'(1) mode consists of a fast component ( $\\left.\\tau_{v-\\nu}=\\sim 2 \\mathrm{ps}, \\sim 20 \\%\\right)$ and a slow component ( $\\left.\\mathrm{T}_{1}=25 \\pm 2 \\mathrm{ps}, \\sim 80 \\%\\right)$, which have been observed for similar rhenium catalysts attached to surfaces. ${ }^{38,} 40,47,53$ The fast component with smaller amplitude can be attributed to the rapid population equilibration between different carbonyl stretching modes, followed by slow recovery of the ground state in tens of picoseconds. ${ }^{38,40}$\\\\\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth, center]{2023_09_22_e69f3d7ce6c4ff487115g-09_286_1354_272_1798}\n\nFigure 3.

Symbols represent experimental data; solid curves represent fits.\n\nFor comparison, we carried out TR-IR measurements for $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in three polar aprotic solvents and we analyzed the dependence of vibrational relaxation rates on the solvent. Figure 3c shows the transient IR absorption spectra of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in acetonitrile (MeCN) under IR excitation at different delay times. The negative bands at $2029 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and positive bands at 2009 $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ are attributed to GSB/SE and ESA of the A'(1) mode, respectively. Similarly, the signals at lower frequency are attributed to GSB/SE and ESA of the A\" and A'(2) modes, respectively. For the different GSB/SE and ESA patterns between TR-IR and TR-SFG spectra, there are two causes. First, the IR spectra are contributed from the imaginary part of $\\chi^{(3)}$, while the SFG spectra contains both real and imaginary parts of $\\chi^{(4)}$. Second, SFG signal is influenced by the molecular orientation of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ on gold surface. Figure $3 \\mathrm{~d}$ shows the transient kinetics fitted by a biexponential decay. The $T_{1}$ lifetime of the $A^{\\prime}(1)$ mode, which is used for further analysis, is found to be $30 \\mathrm{ps}$. The $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ lifetime of the $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}(1)$ mode is found to be $23 \\mathrm{ps}$ in acetone and $25 \\mathrm{ps}$ in dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively (Table 1, SI). The $T_{1}$ lifetimes of the A\"/A'(2) modes, which is close to that of $A^{\\prime}(1)$ mode, are also listed in the Table 1 . The present results also show that $\\tau_{v-v}$ for $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in bulk solution is shorter than that of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$. As shown in Figures S3 and S4, the transient IR absorption spectra have similar features as those in MeCN except the GSB/SE signals for the A\" and A'(2) modes that are more separated.\n\nTable 1. $\\tau_{v-v}$ and $T_{1}$ Lifetimes of the $A^{\\prime}(1)$ and $A^{\\prime \\prime} / A^{\\prime}(2)$ Modes for $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in Different Environments.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_09_22_e69f3d7ce6c4ff487115g-10_1638_2205_212_1913}\n\\end{center}\n\nTable S3 provides the frequencies of the molecule in each solvent. Since these frequencies are not in resonance with the carbonyl stretches in the molecule, direct energy transfer to solvent is unlikely. More likely is that IVR is sped up coupling to low frequency modes in the solvent to make up for frequency mismatch between modes in the molecule..$^{54-55}$\n\nTable 2.

There are three possible mechanisms for vibrational relaxation of the $\\mathrm{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$ system (in the absence of solvent): intramolecular vibrational relaxation to non-carbonyl modes ( $T_{\\text {Intra }}$ ), coupling to phonons (T $\\left.T_{\\text {Phonon }}\\right)$, and direct energy transfer to the substrate via EHP (TEHP), as indicated in Eq. (1):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T_{1}}=\\frac{1}{T_{\\text {Intra }}}+\\frac{1}{T_{\\text {Phomon }}}+\\frac{1}{T_{E H P}}\n\\]\n\nThe equivalent mechanisms in the presence of solvent are indicated in Eq. (2), where $T_{\\text {inter }}$ indicates intermolecular vibrational relaxation of the carbonyl modes to the solvent.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T_{1}}=\\frac{1}{T_{\\text {Intra }}}+\\frac{1}{T_{\\text {Inter }}}\n\\]\n\nThe faster full recovery of the $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$ ground state, compared to the recovery of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CN}$, suggests that the substrate likely contributes to vibrational relaxation. While $\\left[\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\right.\\right.$ bipy- $\\left.\\left(\\mathrm{OCO}-\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\right)_{11} \\mathrm{~S}\\right)_{2}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3}(\\mathrm{Cl})\\right] / \\mathrm{Au} \\quad$ and $\\quad\\left[\\operatorname{Re}(\\text { bipy-COOH })_{2}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3}(\\mathrm{Cl})\\right] / \\mathrm{DMF}$ exhibited nearly identical kinetics when bound to the Au surface by long alkyl chains $(\\sim 10 \\AA){ }^{38}$ the $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ is now much closer to the Au surface. Since covalently bonded alkyl chains should yield a stronger coupling to surface phonons than physisorbed molecules, it is unlikely that TPhonon yields a large contribution to the relaxation, since the kinetics of the chemisorbed and physisorbed systems were similar, which only leaves $T_{E H P}$ as a potentially important contribution besides $T_{I V R}$.\n\nTo study the effect of $T_{E H P}$ on $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$, we calculated EHP-induced relaxation rates using time dependent perturbation theory (TDPT) on the basis of our DFT calculations, as described in the theoretical methods section. ${ }^{19-20}$ The corresponding relaxation lifetimes (rates) in Table 2 (Table S4) show that only the A'(2) mode has a lifetime comparable to the experimental value (25 ps), although our calculations seem to overestimate EHP. Therefore, we conclude that nonadiabatic vibrational relaxation occurs mostly through the A'(2) stretch. Figure 2 explains the overall trend: $A^{\\prime}(2)$ relaxes faster since the axial $C O$ is close to the surface during the displacement, enhancing the orbital overlap; A\" relaxes slowest since the axial CO is barely displaced at all; and $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}(2)$ relaxes somewhere in between. Our results suggest that EHP can contribute to vibrational relaxation on the same time scale as IVR. To compare EHP and IVR, we have performed MD simulations of IVR of $\\mathrm{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl}$ in the gas-phase. The results, shown in Table 2, suggest that both of these processes contribute significantly to the vibrational relaxation of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$, and neither effect can be ruled out. Similarly in solution, while solvent induced effects could be estimated using force field MD simulations, ${ }^{56}$ typically direct energy transfer can occur on the same timescale of about $10 \\mathrm{ps},{ }^{57-60}$ so it is difficult to disentangle from solvent-mediated IVR, which can occur on the timescale of about 1 ps. $^{54,61-65}$\n\nThe reported results provide fundamental understanding of energy transfer that may limit the effectiveness of catalysts mounted on metals. Diminished vibrational lifetimes due to EHPs will negatively affect the ability to modify bonds. As EHP effects lead to mode-selective and localized energy transfer between adsorbates and the surface under ambient conditions, the reverse process could be observed upon excitation of the substrate, serving as a new pathway for plasmonic enhancement of catalytic activity. ${ }^{66-68}$ We have observed similar mode-selective energy transfer in the dissociative chemisorption of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ onto Ag(111) surfaces. ${ }^{69}$\n\nIn summary, we have applied time-resolved SFG spectroscopy and DFT to study vibrational relaxation dynamics of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$. The kinetics of vibrational relaxation were found to exhibit biexponential decays including an ultrafast initial relaxation associated with fast population transfer between carbonyl stretches and a complete recovery of the ground vibrational state, dominated by a combination of nonadiabatic relaxation due to excitation of EHP in the metal and IVR. $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} /$ Au system exhibits a similar $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ to those of the catalyst in vacuo and in solvents, which indicates that coordination to gold induces EHP-mediated vibrational relaxation on the same scale as (solvent-mediated) IVR. EHP-mediated energy loss affects the CO stretching modes near the rhenium, particularly, the $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}(2)$. We find that contact with the surface is another feature that can be used to either modify vibrational energy transfer and catalysis. While EHP-induced vibrational relaxation could be one reason for the so often observed catalytic efficiency loss upon adsorption, it might also offer a viable way to selectively control catalysis via laser-driven EHP enhancement recently coined as \"hot-electron chemistry\", $66-67$\n\n\\section{Experimental Details}\nThe broadband vibrational SFG setup is based on a $1 \\mathrm{kHz}$ Spitfire Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Spectra Physics) and TOPAS-C (Light Conversion) as described in the SI. ${ }^{38,40}$ The pump and unpumped SFG signals were separated using a galvanometric servocontrolled optical scanning mirror (Cambridge Technology) as described in the SI. ${ }^{70}$ The angle of incidence for the visible and probe IR pulses were $65^{\\circ}$ and $50^{\\circ}$ with respect to the surface normal, respectively. The SFG, visible, probe IR and pump IR beams were $p$-polarized. The SFG spectra of $\\operatorname{Re}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3} \\mathrm{Cl} / \\mathrm{Au}$ were normalized by the SFG spectra of a bare gold thin film measured under the same conditions.\n\n\\section{Theoretical Details}\nDFT calculations were performed with the electronic structure code FHI-aims (version: 161122) with \"light\" local orbital basis set and integration grid settings. ${ }^{71}$ The (111) gold surface was modeled with a $(5 \\times 4)$ primitive surface unit cell and 4 layers of Au substrate (bottom two frozen), built using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE). ${ }^{72}$ The functional was $\\mathrm{PBE}^{51,73}$ as corrected with the atomic zeroth order scalar relativistic approximation (ZORA). Long-range dispersion interactions have been accounted for with the $\\mathrm{vdW}^{\\text {surf }}$ method by Ruiz et al. ${ }^{52}$ Vibrational relaxation rates were calculated using first order TDPT based on ground Kohn-Sham eigenstates using the coolvib code. ${ }^{4-5,} 45$ Nonadiabatic matrix elements for the three carbonyl stretch modes have been calculated with FHI-aims using finite difference displacements and a 4 $\\times 4 \\times 1$ Monkhorst-Pack k-grid. ${ }^{74-75}$ The sum over electronic states in the relaxation rate expression was converged with a spectral Gaussian broadening of width $0.1 \\mathrm{eV}^{20}$ Electronic states up to $6 \\mathrm{eV}$ above the Fermi level were included and the electronic temperature was $300 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\nGas phase IVR was calculated using ab initio MD performed with ASE coupled to FHI-aims ${ }^{71}$ using a Langevin (constant NVT) thermostat at $300 \\mathrm{~K}$ with a friction value of $0.1$ a.u. Thus, classical MD was evaluated along the DFT (PBE with \"light\" on Re, Cl, but with \"light\\_194\" (reduced integration grid) on all other elements) potential energy surface using a heat bath generating a fluctuating force and a friction term to maintain a constant temperature.\n\n\\section{ASSOCIATED CONTENT}\nSupporting Information.
