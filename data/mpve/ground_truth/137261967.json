Nano structured Ni-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films were deposited by the chemical method on a glass substrate. The prepared thin film was characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDX. The crystal size calculated from XRD is about 26.2 nm. The SEM analysis reveals nano spherical morphology of average particle size about 92 nm. The optical analysis was carried by using UV- visible spectroscopy. The band gap estimated from absorbance spectra for thin film was around 3.5 eV, making suitable Ni-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> for photocatalytic removal of hazardous Ponceau S dye.", "material_source_table": " ", "property_name": "Band gap\nEnergy band gap\noptical band gap\nE<sub>g</sub>", "property_descriptor": " ", "property_source_passage": "Transmittance spectra of Ni doped TiO<sub>2</sub> thin &#64257;lm shows that &#64257;lm is highly transparent in the visible wavelength region, with an average transmittance of about 55 %.
